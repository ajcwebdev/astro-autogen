## Transcript

[00:00] And we are live as John disappears on the side! Welcome to the NAV bar!

[00:06] Welcome to the NAV bar! Just one sip of water.

[00:10] Listen to this.

[00:12] Oh, look at that! Simon's got the spicy water again.

[00:16] It's a must.

[00:20] How are you doing, John? We are live with zero people watching, but it's not what it's about.

[00:26] Yeah, I'm obsessing with trying to get this light working, even though we're just not going to worry about it.

[00:32] I keep saying we're not going to worry about it, and then I keep worrying about it.

[00:35] This is a content creator's endless life. I'll just join you in the misery like this.

[00:42] Yeah, we just need double dark.

[00:45] Well, the problem is we're going to do, like, this is going to be the first one where we, I was planning on, like, taking the video and...

[00:52] The HD fancy. But you look great! Dude, you've got, like, the little triangle and the, like, you have the three-point lightning. Lightning McQueen.

[01:02] I do have the light behind me, yeah. You actually look even better than me. You have that, like, profile. Whatever.

[01:08] Yeah, it looks kind of, like, yeah, really moody and, yeah, cinematic. Let's go with cinematic.

[01:16] All right. I'm going to cut all of that from the start, and we're going to start the podcast from here.

[01:22] Yeah. John wants to be professional. He's going to take a deep breath.

[01:26] Hello, Simon. Welcome to another episode of The Nav Bar. How have you been this week?

[01:35] I have been awesome. This week is probably the busiest of my year so far.

[01:41] It's only Tuesday. No, it's Wednesday, but I've been basically working two jobs in one.

[01:46] It's by design, and it's all my fault, but I'm doing a lot of things, and I have visiting family as well.

[01:55] The in-laws and the doggie are here. So it's a full picture. Very busy life.

[02:00] Yes, that always makes a huge difference, having guests and trying to get anything done.

[02:06] At least you're, like me, you've got, like, a separate space, separate from the house, where you can do some work

[02:12] and do some recording and do podcasts. It's fantastic.

[02:15] It is not separate to the degree of where it should be when the kids are home and the dogs and the puppies are crazy.

[02:23] But now they're in school, and the dogs, when no one's here, they kind of chill for a bit.

[02:27] We can talk about whatever you want, but what's happening in my life here is I have a full-time job at ThinkMeal.

[02:36] As you can see, shout out to ThinkMeal. Great people like me and lots of others.

[02:40] So that's my 9 to 5. In Australia, where we record this, the financial year ends in June,

[02:49] and people have budgets, and then they have to use their budgets before the end of the financial year.

[02:54] And in consulting, quite often, it translates to clients saying, "Oh, maybe we should hire a consultancy to use the budget

[03:01] and build that cool stuff before the end of the financial year."

[03:04] So there's a little crunch, and I've jumped into a project until the end of June to help with the team.

[03:10] But in parallel, I'm doing all my courses that I've actually never really talked about.

[03:16] I have joined CanXidots on the Epic Web Platform. It's not exactly a secret. I think people have heard about it.

[03:22] I've spoken at the Epic Web Conference.

[03:25] But essentially, when you create workshops, what happens is you have to validate them with real users.

[03:32] So you do live workshops on Zoom, or I use a thing called Gather.

[03:37] But the idea is you have 20 people, and you deliver your workshop, and then they've bought tickets,

[03:43] so they're going to tell you their honest opinion if they like it or not, I guess.

[03:47] It's like real user testing, and then once you validate this, you can go and record the actual video-based course

[03:54] that is the thing that hopefully sells quite well.

[03:56] It's such a good idea to get so many iterations through of saying the same thing.

[04:01] It's like writing a really in-depth script and practicing it a bunch. You tighten everything up.

[04:07] And by the time you come to actually recording, I imagine it's seamless.

[04:13] I imagine it takes a lot less time to record the final product because you've practiced it so much,

[04:19] and you've worked out all of those kinks, and you've really optimized the pathway to get from A to B.

[04:26] Totally. Yeah, so I've delivered the workshop live twice.

[04:30] So the first one was a little bit rough. There was too much content for the time allocated.

[04:34] So I thought, "Oh, let's remove content." And then speaking with Kent, I was like,

[04:38] "No, no, no. We can also make it a two-day workshop, and if need be, add an extra one more to make sure

[04:44] there's enough for a second full day." And so that's what I've done.

[04:47] I've done it into a second workshop, a two-day-long workshop for the second iteration.

[04:52] And I have delivered this literally last week, Thursday, Friday. It went really, really, really well.

[04:58] The first time was a bit stressful, and I was like, "Stop asking questions. We've got to go against the clock."

[05:04] So I started the workshop by telling them, "Please interrupt me. It's a live workshop.

[05:08] You have the chance to stir the direction of the discussions."

[05:12] And by halfway, I was like, "Everyone, mute yourself. Don't talk to me.

[05:16] I've got a workshop to deliver," which is not great.

[05:20] So this second one, we had plenty more time, and we did go on all these side quests

[05:24] when someone had questions, even some TypeScript stuff, unrelated. We did a little deep dive.

[05:29] And yeah, that was really cool. The feedback has been exceptionally good.

[05:34] We have a five-star rating system. And remember, it's paying customers.

[05:38] I'm not asking my friend and my mom to give me a gold star.

[05:42] I'm asking people who paid their money and their time to attend.

[05:46] And so if the results of the feedback is good enough,

[05:52] it kind of gives you an indication that the product should be ready to prepare.

[05:57] And so that was Thursday, Friday, and I was like, "Oh, my God, I can finally record this thing."

[06:02] That's like all the work I've done with Kent, ultimately, is to end up with this product

[06:08] that people start buying, yeah? I've created tutorials and tips and all these videos for free,

[06:14] and I've done workshops, and all of this is just in preparation for the thing that is actually the product.

[06:20] And it's like a life coincidence, but now that I finally have this runway

[06:25] to just go and record like crazy is also when I start this full-time consulting job,

[06:30] which is like when you onboard a new project, it's always kind of demanding.

[06:35] You need to immerse yourself into the code base, and not that you work extra hours,

[06:40] but you really need your full focus, and it makes it super hard to think of other things.

[06:45] So what I've done is, except recording now, I have been very strict.

[06:52] My 9 to 5 is my day job, and I do the consulting thing, and then when the kids go to bed,

[06:58] I don't want to live my life always like this, but this week has been kids go to bed at 7,

[07:02] they start reading and put themselves to bed, and I come back here,

[07:06] and I did yesterday three and a half hours of recording till 10.30 p.m.,

[07:10] and then this morning at 6 a.m., I send them to basketball, and I went in here for two hours,

[07:15] and I've recorded until the start of the workday, essentially.

[07:19] So this is why I'm joking about the two jobs, two lives.

[07:22] I have this educator content recorder, and then the consulting thing, and then the visiting family.

[07:30] So I've been busy, as you can tell.

[07:32] Yeah, and then you've got the nav bar on top of that.

[07:34] So yeah, I really appreciate you taking the time to still record an episode.

[07:38] It sounds like it's a very, very busy time.

[07:41] And back on that, that workshop structure is such a good way to, like you're saying,

[07:47] get feedback from paying people.

[07:49] People are going to tell you the truth because they've given you money,

[07:52] and their expectations are set at a particular level.

[07:55] And so they're going to give you really honest feedback,

[07:57] and not just the feedback that you get to tighten up the material that you have,

[08:02] but delivering it in that live context and being there with the people

[08:07] synchronously while they work through it.

[08:09] I'm sure you would identify all kinds of areas where you're like, "Oh, right.

[08:14] I really need to explain that in a different way,"

[08:17] or "I really need to make sure I reiterate that thing from earlier

[08:21] because it's just getting lost."

[08:23] And so I imagine those side quests and questions that come up

[08:26] and just you observing these people going through the course

[08:32] would really help identify areas that you either need to tighten up

[08:36] or areas you need to dive a little deeper into.

[08:39] Yeah, absolutely.

[08:41] An example of that is in the workshop, like the main focus is responsive design

[08:46] and then animations.

[08:48] And there's one exercise that's almost like to me in the middle,

[08:51] "Oh, quick aside. Let's quickly do that because we need to do this."

[08:54] And it's like the interaction styles like hover and focus.

[08:57] And usually for other exercises, I have a very specific description.

[09:02] So there's a lot of materials that go with my presentation.

[09:05] So the learners are on the workshop app, and they read the instructions,

[09:10] and there's lots of links to MDN documentation and Tailwind docs

[09:12] and all that stuff.

[09:14] And one of the chapters, I just assume, "Oh, quick, simple.

[09:17] We're going to do the hover styles on the link.

[09:19] So just do the hover and focus styles to match the Figma design."

[09:23] And then I sent them thinking, "Oh, it's going to take five minutes."

[09:26] And at the end of this workshop, there were three different people that said,

[09:29] "Hey, the instructions were not really helpful for this one."

[09:33] And I literally--the instruction was like, "Small step but pretty important

[09:37] for accessibility and usability. Go and copy the interaction styles."

[09:42] And I didn't realize that the focus styles with ring utilities

[09:46] and all that stuff is actually quite tricky and technical.

[09:50] And I just took it for granted.

[09:52] And three people said in the feedback, "Hey, you should at least hint

[09:55] that you can use outline or ring utilities and the difference

[09:59] between borders and outlines with how it takes space of the layout

[10:04] and makes everything shift by one pixel if you use border because of the box model

[10:08] versus the outline or box shadow that kind of floats around."

[10:11] And I was like, "Oh, yeah, that's one area where I completely assumed

[10:15] this is basic knowledge from, like, Tailwind 101."

[10:19] And actually, it's a bit more than that.

[10:21] So I've added some clearer instructions and it kind of, yeah,

[10:25] just smoothens the whole experience like you said.

[10:28] Hmm, that's awesome. Yeah, I can't wait to actually see the final product.

[10:33] All of your workshops have been at very inconvenient times.

[10:36] I feel sorry for you having to get up at all crazy hours of the night

[10:40] or early, early morning.

[10:42] But, yeah, I'm looking forward to being able to step through it at my own pace

[10:45] and see that really, like, concise, like, boiled down version of this course.

[10:50] I think it's going to be amazing.

[10:51] Do you have any idea as to when the launch of that will be?

[10:55] Are we allowed to talk about that yet?

[10:57] Yes. Well, the answer is no, I don't know.

[11:00] The reason I'm pushing really, really hard is my workshop is on Tailwind v3.

[11:06] There is, in the background, a parallel world where the Tailwind team

[11:10] is about to ship Tailwind v4, which renders a whole lot of my workshop

[11:15] not obsolete, but it kind of suddenly it's not the recommended way to do things.

[11:22] So if I record now, I'm about halfway through the recording

[11:26] after my big push from last night and this morning.

[11:29] If I stop now and I'm like, oh, let's just, like, I'm going to,

[11:32] I'm going to, like, I got to slow down, otherwise burn out, whatever.

[11:35] I'm going to slow down and then I'm going to take a few more weeks.

[11:38] And then the team, the Epic Web team, has to go and upload the videos

[11:43] and generate transcript and write.

[11:45] They basically write a blog post for each video based on the content,

[11:49] which takes them a few weeks as well.

[11:52] So if I go in this, like, let's slow down pattern,

[11:55] then before the thing ships, Tailwind 4 will be out and we'll be like,

[11:59] oh, Simon, you're 80% recorded.

[12:02] Maybe you should start again from zero with v4.

[12:05] So whatever, it's very possible, even at the speed I go,

[12:08] it's possible that Adam, at the end of this recording, has announced,

[12:11] like, we never know, like, the only thing I know is Adam said,

[12:16] hopefully it's ready for the summer.

[12:18] The summer in Northern Hemisphere is basically June is the start of summer.

[12:23] June is, like, next week.

[12:25] So, you know, we don't know what happens.

[12:28] But in saying that, because basically the big difference,

[12:32] let's switch to Tailwind context for a bit.

[12:35] We do a lot of theme customization in my workshop.

[12:38] And in v3, now, even if you use v4, you can't use the JavaScript configuration

[12:45] because it's all moving to CSS.

[12:48] And so I was like, I don't want to teach something that doesn't exist yet

[12:51] because it might change, and I spoke with Adam,

[12:53] and he kind of think I had the right approach.

[12:55] Just keep teaching v3 and kind of introduce people to the fact that it's going to change.

[13:00] And so I thought, because v4 will eventually support a JavaScript config,

[13:05] and I thought to give my thing a little bit more shelf life,

[13:08] at the start of the workshop, which I've already recorded, I say,

[13:12] if you're on v4 and you're watching this, just know that what we do still works,

[13:17] and at the end of the workshop, on the last lesson,

[13:19] we'll move everything to the better way of doing it in Tailwind v4.

[13:22] So just stick around.

[13:24] And also I thought, even when v4 comes out,

[13:27] there will be a lot of people on v3 that don't necessarily have the time

[13:31] or the option to upgrade, even if the upgrade is really simple.

[13:34] Tailwind makes it really easy all the time.

[13:36] And I was like, there's a value even after v4 ships

[13:39] to show how to do it in a v3 compatible way.

[13:42] And I'm not punishing anyone because the last chapter really moves everything

[13:46] how you would do it with v4.

[13:48] So basically, you can do the whole workshop

[13:50] and ignore the fact you work in JavaScript,

[13:52] knowing that you're going to move that.

[13:54] And first, I thought I need to re-record everything

[13:56] with the proper way of doing things,

[13:58] but I think it kind of makes sense to say,

[14:01] like, it's still all relevant.

[14:03] It's just we do everything v3 way, and then we move it at the end.

[14:06] So I think even after v4, it would still be up to date,

[14:10] and it's not something that's completely wrong or out of shelf life,

[14:16] if you know what I mean.

[14:17] If it's not even on the shelf yet.

[14:19] That's awesome. Yeah.

[14:23] And so do the people that went to the workshop,

[14:26] do they get discounted stuff for the course,

[14:29] or they've just helped turn it into the most epic web Tailwind course ever?

[14:36] Yeah, man, they're my biggest supporters,

[14:38] the ones that believe in you at the start.

[14:40] They get a big fat 100% discount on the product.

[14:43] So anyone who attended the live workshop gets--

[14:46] they still have to buy it because you get to get the license,

[14:49] but they have a magic little coupon

[14:51] that's going to take every little penny of the price.

[14:54] And that's the least I could do without these people that support me.

[14:59] I can't validate my stuff.

[15:01] I can't also generate a bit of runway because the ticket sales,

[15:05] some of it goes to me to basically support the whole

[15:09] creating space and time to build that stuff.

[15:12] So yes, the answer is yes.

[15:14] Awesome.

[15:15] And I also kind of owe them to--

[15:17] because we don't provide recordings of the live workshops,

[15:19] and a lot of people say, "Hey, I'd love to get back to something we saw."

[15:23] So I kind of owe them to these people to not spend three years

[15:27] to record the course that I said,

[15:29] part of the attending to the workshop, you get this for free,

[15:32] and then it never comes up.

[15:33] So a bit of accountability, which is never bad.

[15:36] Yeah. Nice.

[15:39] Well, I'm very excited to purchase it, watch it,

[15:44] and actually learn how to use Tailwind properly

[15:46] instead of the hacky way that I force a square through a circle.

[15:52] I just want to circle back to one thing you said,

[15:54] which it makes a lot of sense.

[15:56] The recording process is actually super easy.

[15:59] It's just very time-consuming because you need--

[16:02] it's all on camera with the lights, and I'm trying to--

[16:05] basically, I'm trying to provide the experience

[16:07] of having me in a live workshop,

[16:09] but you can't talk to me because it's not live,

[16:11] but it must feel as much as you--

[16:13] if you're in the workshop with me as possible.

[16:15] So I deliver it just like if I was delivering a real live workshop.

[16:19] And so it kind of takes the same amount of time to record

[16:23] than a real workshop delivery, which was two days.

[16:26] And then you add the editing on top.

[16:28] But the beauty of it is because I've gone through twice.

[16:32] I have every little problem, solution, and the diffing between.

[16:37] So I can literally open on the secondary monitor the solution,

[16:41] and then I can walk people through the--

[16:43] first, I introduce the problem and say, "Hey, this is what you got to do.

[16:46] Check out these links, and then good luck.

[16:48] I'll see you on the other side."

[16:49] And then I do another video where I teach--

[16:51] that's the longer part where I teach how I implement that.

[16:54] And I can literally make sure that I tick all the boxes

[16:57] to reach the solution like in the workshop.

[17:00] So all the work is pre-cut and organized,

[17:03] so I don't have to do any thinking, "How do I want to teach this?"

[17:06] It's all completely laid out.

[17:08] I just have to go through my to-do list of 71 video segments.

[17:13] If you follow me on Twitter, you've seen updates

[17:15] from like recorded three to five to--

[17:18] last night I've reached the thing where the to-do column

[17:21] becomes shorter than the done or the recorded,

[17:24] and it's like such a milestone.

[17:26] And today, my last video took me to 40%--

[17:31] 39% of to-do left.

[17:33] In Notion, you can do a count thing by--

[17:36] I've put the labels like to-do, recorded, edited.

[17:40] And the ones with the to-do badge, which have nothing done,

[17:43] have 39% of the total left.

[17:46] So I've done 60% of the recordings and maybe 3% of editing,

[17:51] but I love this part, and I'm pretty good at it.

[17:54] - Awesome. Yeah, and I like what you said before,

[17:58] that sometimes there are those crunch times,

[18:00] and you really appreciate those hours that you can fit in extra time.

[18:05] Not something you want to do all of the time,

[18:07] but when there's a big project or something that is meaningful to you

[18:12] where you're not feeling like you're forced,

[18:15] like you're being dragged back to work in the evening to keep doing it,

[18:18] if you're feeling excited about getting back into it

[18:20] in that evening time and being really productive,

[18:23] it can feel really, really good.

[18:25] Yes, just make sure you take that rest at the end

[18:28] after these videos are finally recorded and edited.

[18:32] - Yeah, you're very right. It's very uplifting.

[18:34] And this thing is 100%--

[18:36] Well, there's people getting their cut and commissioned,

[18:38] but this is the thing that I've chose to do,

[18:40] and it's hopefully going to open really big doors for me.

[18:44] So the closer I get to this goal, the more excited I get.

[18:47] And I was literally, after a big day of work

[18:49] and three hours of recording last night,

[18:51] this morning I opened my eyes, I was like,

[18:53] "All right, get the kids out, and I can go sneak

[18:55] like five, six videos before 9 a.m. when I start my job."

[18:58] And in the real world, when you skip going outside the day before,

[19:02] you should probably go for a walk or something,

[19:04] but I was just so eager to get into that recording,

[19:07] knowing that eventually it'll pass and I'll go jump in the water,

[19:12] go walking, play basketball or something.

[19:14] But this week is all about just trying to get closer

[19:17] to this goal of mine that's been sitting there for a long time,

[19:20] and now it feels very real.

[19:22] Yeah, yeah, it's very exciting.

[19:25] We've been talking about this, I think, since we started the NavBar.

[19:27] Yes.

[19:28] When we started the NavBar, that was one of the goals,

[19:31] was to have another avenue that we can talk about projects

[19:34] that we're working on.

[19:36] And yeah, that was right when you had left Tailwind Labs

[19:40] and were starting to do your own thing,

[19:43] and I think you had just started at Thinkmill as well.

[19:45] So yeah, it's amazing seeing that progression

[19:48] and seeing that we're getting closer to that moment

[19:51] that you've been sort of, you know,

[19:53] those goalposts you've been heading towards.

[19:55] It's awesome.

[19:56] Yeah.

[19:57] With trying to emulate the live experience in course format,

[20:03] when people purchase the course,

[20:06] do they get access to a course platform or a Slack channel

[20:09] or something where they can ask questions and kind of,

[20:11] if they do get stuck, still have that support from you

[20:14] or someone else on the team?

[20:16] Yes, very good question.

[20:18] So that's one thing that's super cool

[20:20] about Kent Cedar's platform, Epic Web.

[20:23] And it is Kent's platform,

[20:25] but it's growing into much more than just Kent.

[20:27] There's a few other instructors that are joining

[20:30] and it is slowly morphing into something

[20:33] more like front-end masters or Pluralsight

[20:37] or some like...

[20:38] Yeah, it's becoming like the dream team

[20:41] of content creators from every field.

[20:43] It's amazing.

[20:44] I'm so excited.

[20:45] Like Chantastic joining.

[20:46] It's just such a great lineup of people.

[20:49] So the big difference,

[20:50] and then I'll answer your question,

[20:51] but the big difference if you compare to front-end masters

[20:54] or something like this is these learning platforms,

[20:57] you can learn everything.

[20:58] You can learn React, Vue, Angular,

[21:00] like all the different stacks.

[21:02] And Epic Web is basically a more opinionated way of...

[21:06] Kent has been building many applications

[21:08] and learning and refining throughout the career.

[21:12] And it's like these tools are what helps me

[21:15] be really productive and successful.

[21:17] And so everything that is taught in the Epic stack

[21:20] is kind of part of this set of tools

[21:22] that Kent has assembled

[21:24] and thinks is a very good way to build applications.

[21:27] It doesn't mean it's the only way,

[21:28] but if you follow these decisions,

[21:31] you don't have to think,

[21:32] "Oh, should I use this framework, this thing?"

[21:36] It kind of makes the decision for you,

[21:38] removes a bit of this paralysis.

[21:40] And that's how I got in

[21:42] because Tailwind CSS was the choice for the styling.

[21:45] And so you would probably never see me teach Emotion

[21:49] or like another CSS approach or BEM or something.

[21:53] I would love to teach raw, like vanilla CSS language.

[21:57] And that's something that Kent is pushing me to do as well.

[22:00] But basically every instructor teaches something

[22:04] that is aligned with the overarching Epic stack thing

[22:07] that Kent assembled.

[22:09] But all this to say,

[22:11] hoping you're still there because you're kind of frozen

[22:13] or you're very passionate about what I'm saying.

[22:17] Most of the content, if not everything,

[22:20] is completely open source and free and available to anyone.

[22:24] Right now, it's all in the open.

[22:27] You can go to github.com/epicwebdev

[22:31] and find the Pixel Perfect Tailwind workshop.

[22:35] There's all the exercises, the problem, the solutions,

[22:38] the instructions that I wrote that took me forever.

[22:42] I'll keep talking while the Australian internet does its thing.

[22:47] But basically, I can hear you laugh, so you can hear me.

[22:50] I'm still here.

[22:53] Yeah, everything.

[22:55] And it almost scared me at the start.

[22:57] I was like, literally the only thing that people buy

[23:00] is access to the videos that I'm recording now.

[23:03] And as you mentioned, a very crucial point

[23:05] is part of the Discord community to access to a special--

[23:10] not Discord server, but a special channel within there

[23:13] for people who bought the course.

[23:15] And as Kent underlines, very importantly,

[23:18] they buy the satisfaction and feeling of good karma

[23:22] that they support the people they learn from.

[23:25] So they buy this feeling of,

[23:27] "Hey, I've got value here and I've given value back."

[23:31] But essentially, everything that I do,

[23:34] the workshop that I taught, people say,

[23:36] "Oh, can I get back to this?"

[23:39] My mom could go and download--

[23:41] well, she would have to NPM install

[23:43] and make sure she has Node 20 and stuff like this.

[23:47] But my repo and Kent's repo and Chan

[23:51] and anyone that is an Epic web instructor,

[23:54] everything is available for free, publicly open source.

[23:58] You can clone the workshop app.

[24:00] It's all out there.

[24:03] And Kent was really proud and said,

[24:05] "It's such a gratifying thing that you can give

[24:07] almost everything away for free."

[24:10] And then where you really deliver the value

[24:13] and clearly it takes time to record videos

[24:15] and do the final polish stuff,

[24:17] this is what people can buy to support you

[24:19] and make it sustainable.

[24:20] And I really, really love that approach of like,

[24:23] "I want to teach everything I can and make it as public as I can

[24:26] and then still find a way to make it sustainable."

[24:29] Yeah, and giving you all that value up front,

[24:32] not only being able to take the course,

[24:34] but even just looking through like,

[24:36] "What are the modules actually going to teach me?"

[24:38] Being able to essentially get a preview

[24:40] that's not just a marketing page telling you

[24:43] all the buzzwords, all the SEO terms

[24:45] that it wants you to land on the page for,

[24:47] but you can literally go in and see

[24:49] what are you going to be building?

[24:51] What sort of topics are you going to be covering?

[24:53] What are going to be the exercises

[24:56] and the different challenges?

[24:58] And then, like you're saying,

[25:00] you can then choose to pay to support that

[25:03] and get that extra value of beautifully recorded videos

[25:07] that are produced by you and the team.

[25:10] Yeah, it's just such a good attitude

[25:12] giving all of that stuff away for free

[25:14] and really like demonstrating the value

[25:17] and people who want to scam the system or whatever

[25:21] can still go and take the course.

[25:23] But yeah, hopefully more people want to support you

[25:26] and get that extra value of those videos.

[25:28] Exactly.

[25:29] And there's always going to be people who want to learn,

[25:31] but they are at a stage of their career

[25:33] where they don't have an employer with a training budget

[25:35] and they're like, "I can't necessarily shell out.

[25:38] I have no idea, by the way,

[25:39] what the price will be for this workshop."

[25:41] But I know some people will be like,

[25:43] "Oh, that's too much. I'm like a freelancer.

[25:45] I don't have any money."

[25:47] And I'm very aware that a large portion of people

[25:50] will be like, "Oh, I can grab the final version

[25:53] of the workshop and I can paste that in my site

[25:55] and I have the design pixel perfect

[25:58] without having to pay Simon,"

[26:00] and that's completely fine.

[26:01] Go ahead and do it if you want.

[26:03] But the hope is that people that go through that

[26:07] say to their boss, "Hey, this course was really good.

[26:09] Maybe we should get a team license or something,"

[26:11] and the karma comes back to you.

[26:13] The more you give, the more things come back.

[26:15] That's what I was going to say.

[26:16] Yeah, those people who might be able to get

[26:19] those learning resources for free

[26:21] that they can't afford right now,

[26:23] it may get them to the point

[26:25] where they're more employable and they get a job

[26:28] and then they want to pay their dues.

[26:31] They want to say thank you.

[26:33] So either getting a team license for it

[26:35] to train up the rest of the team

[26:37] or even just down the line,

[26:39] wanting to support auth and everything,

[26:43] anything that you could want to do

[26:45] in building an app.

[26:48] And so I wonder if some of these,

[26:50] whether the React compiler

[26:51] and some of these other things,

[26:54] how that will work with Laravel.

[26:58] Yeah, it'll be interesting.

[27:00] Whether it will change the patterns

[27:01] versus using it for just rendering UI

[27:03] versus now moving some of that data fetching stuff

[27:06] across to the React components and things like that.

[27:09] Yeah, something I've heard many times in this week

[27:12] and I don't really understand why

[27:14] because I haven't looked into server components that much,

[27:16] but a lot of people seem to say

[27:17] now that server components are here,

[27:19] it makes the ability to build something

[27:22] like Django or Laravel or Rails much more feasible.

[27:26] One thing about Laravel is you're right,

[27:28] you can have Laravel as a backend

[27:30] and then API endpoints

[27:31] and then the frontend you just consume an API

[27:34] like you would hit Superbase

[27:35] or you would hit any like GraphQL API or whatever.

[27:40] But they have that little glue library thing in the middle

[27:44] that is not exclusive to Laravel

[27:46] and not exclusive to React.

[27:47] It's called Inertia.

[27:49] And basically what it does

[27:50] is it intercepts all the network requests

[27:52] and then turns it into something

[27:54] like React think is a SPA or something like this.

[27:57] So you can have authentication

[27:59] and email and all this stuff on the backend,

[28:01] but then as a monolith,

[28:03] you can have routes that turns out to be React components

[28:06] instead of just blades, templates or HTML pages.

[28:09] And in there you can access the user

[28:11] to see if they're authenticated.

[28:13] You can fire like you have that monolith.

[28:16] It feels like you're building

[28:17] just a simple backend full stack app

[28:20] with like templates that talk to the server,

[28:22] but then you have access because it's React.

[28:24] You can do all the crazy stuff,

[28:26] use Radix UI,

[28:27] just do JavaScript stuff on the front end,

[28:30] but you magically have props coming from the server,

[28:33] which is, it's insane.

[28:34] Like you have the best of both worlds

[28:36] and you build this monolith application

[28:38] that can be Next.js.

[28:40] Actually, it's not Next.js.

[28:41] You can use React or Vue or I think Svelte.

[28:45] And then Inertia kinda brings this thing.

[28:47] And in Aaron's video, that's where the most,

[28:51] like the back to front is completely seamless

[28:54] with that Inertia thing.

[28:56] And that's approaching it from the JavaScript front end.

[28:59] And then Laravel is also something called LiveWire,

[29:02] which is very similar to Phoenix has called LiveVue.

[29:06] And I think HotWire was in Rails,

[29:08] which were probably the first ones to do it.

[29:11] And it's the other way.

[29:12] It's like using backends to magically do JavaScript

[29:15] front end updates without writing JavaScript, basically.

[29:18] - Right.

[29:19] - And between all this approach,

[29:20] if you're a backend dev or front end dev

[29:22] or middle stack dev,

[29:23] you can find something that works really well.

[29:26] And I just think it's worth exploring.

[29:28] It's really cool space.

[29:29] - Absolutely.

[29:30] Yeah, I really, I've said many times and as have you,

[29:34] but I think you've actually made the time

[29:35] to play around with Laravel and actually build something.

[29:39] 'Cause even if you're not planning to transition

[29:42] into being a Laravel dev full time or whatever,

[29:44] just learning any language or any other framework

[29:47] always gives you more of an appreciation for,

[29:50] or a better understanding of the framework

[29:53] that you might be more familiar with as well.

[29:55] And so going and using something like Laravel,

[29:58] you come back and you're like,

[29:59] all right, I get how this works,

[30:00] or I get these limitations or yeah,

[30:04] it gives you just kind of a better understanding

[30:06] and appreciation for all of it.

[30:08] I really like what you said there

[30:09] about being able to detect who the user is

[30:14] throughout the full stack.

[30:15] That's one of the huge benefits of Superbase.

[30:19] One of the reasons that I really liked it initially

[30:22] and why I ended up getting a job there

[30:24] and talking about it for the last three years or so

[30:27] is that idea of being able to just detect

[30:31] who the user is anywhere.

[30:32] And that's because all of this stuff

[30:33] is in the Superbase ecosystem.

[30:35] And so if you have auth and you also have data fetching

[30:38] and you also have your authorization layer

[30:41] all in Superbase,

[30:42] then you can see who that user is in any of those pieces.

[30:46] So you know who the user is on the client side,

[30:49] you know who they are on the server,

[30:51] and you know who they are in the database.

[30:52] So when you're doing an actual call to the database

[30:55] trying to fetch data that a particular user can see,

[30:58] you can change your queries.

[31:02] You can write authorization rules

[31:04] that only allow that specific user

[31:06] to see specific data from the database.

[31:09] And that idea of being able to...

[31:13] All of those pieces tying together

[31:15] is just so much more convenient.

[31:17] When you go to actually build an application,

[31:20] you need all of those pieces to be working together

[31:24] as a cohesive application.

[31:26] You don't want to have to write some authorization layer

[31:31] between every single piece of this massive

[31:34] like micro...

[31:36] What was it called?

[31:37] Microsystem architecture or whatever,

[31:39] where you've got all of these different pieces

[31:41] and then you need to worry about

[31:42] what are all of these pieces allowed to see

[31:44] and how do I get the user safely between all of these pieces?

[31:48] Having everything in this one space

[31:51] is just so much more convenient,

[31:53] makes so much more sense when building a real application.

[31:56] Yeah, man.

[31:58] I want to say two more things on the topic.

[32:00] First of all, I'm a JavaScript front-end HTML CSS dev,

[32:05] and I would typically be the sort of people

[32:08] that use Laravel with Inertia and React

[32:11] because I already know React,

[32:12] and that's what I did first.

[32:13] I was like, "Oh, yeah, my comfort zone.

[32:15] I know how to build stuff,

[32:16] and then I have access to all this backend stuff,

[32:18] and it's amazing."

[32:20] And then I thought,

[32:21] "Everyone is raving about this total stack,

[32:24] which is Tailwind, AlpineJS, Laravel, and LiveWire."

[32:28] And I was like, "Oh, I got to look into this."

[32:31] And then I realized instantly it's like LiveWire is for PHP devs

[32:36] so they can write front-end code

[32:37] without having to write JavaScript.

[32:39] They can do it in PHP,

[32:40] and I was like, "Oh, yeah, okay."

[32:41] So I'm not a backend dev.

[32:43] I'm not a PHP dev,

[32:44] so it's really not the thing for me,

[32:46] and I kind of brushed it off.

[32:48] And then I spoke to a bunch of different JS devs,

[32:51] Chris Sevileja?

[32:53] Chris Sev from Scotch.io,

[32:56] and then now he's doing VideoTap.

[32:58] Really cool guy, and he said,

[32:59] "Dude, I'm a JS dev.

[33:01] You have to try LiveWire.

[33:02] You will really flip out how cool it is."

[33:05] And then Josh Seery,

[33:07] who just recently joined the Laravel team,

[33:09] he's kind of found a nice niche corner

[33:11] as the JS Laravel guy

[33:14] that transitioned from JavaScript to Laravel.

[33:16] And he also said, "Dude, LiveWire is really cool.

[33:20] It's not that hard to learn,

[33:21] especially if you know how AlpineJS works.

[33:23] You basically sprinkle some attributes on elements."

[33:26] It feels a bit like Vue.

[33:28] It feels a bit like Alpine.

[33:29] Anyway, I thought LiveWire was not for me,

[33:33] and this is where I had by far the most fun

[33:35] because of what you just said.

[33:38] You build almost everything

[33:40] as a simple dump server to render pages.

[33:44] So you have your server template language.

[33:46] You can do loops.

[33:47] Anywhere you want to know if someone's logged in,

[33:49] you can go @auth,

[33:50] and it's like a block.

[33:52] And inside of there,

[33:53] we'll only show if the user's logged in.

[33:55] And you can go @guests, and it's the opposite.

[33:57] Like if someone's logged in, they won't see that.

[33:59] And you have all these incredibly elegant helpers

[34:02] that Laravel provides with the Blade templating language.

[34:05] And basically, you can do almost everything in a UI

[34:09] except client-side, like optimistic UI

[34:12] and all this fancy stuff.

[34:13] And this is where LiveWire steps in

[34:17] because it lets you synchronize data

[34:20] from the backend to the frontend.

[34:22] And LiveWire inside of it has AlpineJS built in.

[34:26] Caleb Porzio is the same person who built both.

[34:28] And so you can increment a button by clicking,

[34:32] and it's going to either do it on the client-side

[34:35] and wait and then do the synchronization,

[34:37] or it's going to send the request and wait and then update.

[34:39] You can always decide,

[34:41] should this fire a network request

[34:43] or should it be just client-side?

[34:44] And both talk to each other really well,

[34:46] and it's just, it's amazing.

[34:47] Like you can do,

[34:49] you can end up doing this really rich,

[34:51] interactive user interfaces,

[34:53] but with the simplicity of just,

[34:54] you feel like you're just building HTML pages

[34:57] with lots of nice helpers.

[34:59] And a mature framework like Laravel,

[35:01] and same with CraftCMS,

[35:03] the templating language has access

[35:05] to every convenience you can think of

[35:07] that people have said,

[35:08] "Oh, we should add this for like a decade."

[35:10] And it's just so robust and simple.

[35:13] And then you sprinkle a bit of LiveWire

[35:15] for the interaction,

[35:16] which is always a bit less than you imagine,

[35:18] unless you do a super rich portal interactive live stuff.

[35:21] And yeah, it's such a nice way to build applications.

[35:25] Really enjoyed it.

[35:26] Hmm.

[35:27] And this is basically what the entire Laravel community

[35:30] has been saying for a while,

[35:31] and especially the last week with all of this,

[35:34] you know, React versus,

[35:37] well, not React versus Laravel,

[35:39] but just, yeah,

[35:40] all the discussion that's going on at the moment

[35:42] is, yeah, like Laravel already has all of this stuff

[35:46] while the JavaScript ecosystem

[35:49] is still trying to kind of like piece all the bits together.

[35:53] And, you know, something like the Epic web stack

[35:56] is a great example of something that could,

[35:59] you know, could be that in the future.

[36:02] Taking all of the pieces

[36:04] that do these things really, really well

[36:06] and putting them together into one place.

[36:08] Yeah, you don't need to make all of these decisions up front.

[36:11] You just get given really good defaults.

[36:14] You get given a really good default auth system.

[36:16] You get given a really good default database

[36:19] and data fetching logic

[36:21] or data fetching like ORM or whatever.

[36:23] And yeah, and then you can just focus on building an application.

[36:27] And if you want to like customize any of that stuff,

[36:29] you just customize one piece.

[36:32] Yep.

[36:33] But you're very right that the PHP world

[36:36] had it going really good for a long time.

[36:39] And they're pretty quietly until now.

[36:42] Now it's getting a bit more vocal,

[36:44] but they've been like quietly winning and shipping.

[36:46] And that's one thing I said.

[36:47] I almost wish that this debate

[36:49] doesn't bleed into the Laravel world

[36:51] because they're just so pragmatic.

[36:53] And one example for me is Tailwind CSS.

[36:56] Like love it or hate it, Tailwind is pretty empowering.

[36:59] And in Laravel, literally every package,

[37:02] every starter kit has Tailwind built in.

[37:05] And nobody, like some people might not like it

[37:07] and they might strip it out, but no one is arguing this.

[37:10] They just go on with it.

[37:11] And it's like, yep, this is the chosen way.

[37:13] It's productive.

[37:14] And I remember I was at the Tailwind Labs team

[37:18] when Next.js started bringing this

[37:21] like server thing and actions.

[37:24] And in the Tailwind Labs team,

[37:27] there is Jonathan Reineck who created Inertia.

[37:30] And I was like, I was trying to explain,

[37:33] I was trying to explain Remix

[37:35] and how it lets you access stuff from the server

[37:38] with a loader and an action.

[37:39] And I was like, it feels like kind of like Next.js

[37:42] is ripping or like taking the idea and running with it.

[37:45] And he said, have you checked Inertia?

[37:47] And I was like, no.

[37:48] And he said, it's basically exactly the same

[37:50] and it's existed for like three years already.

[37:53] And basically it does the magic glue

[37:56] between your server and front-end

[37:57] and can talk to each other.

[37:59] And I realized, wow, like this, like Remix,

[38:03] the way they've done it is different obviously.

[38:06] But it was completely like groundbreaking.

[38:08] And then I realized people have been doing this

[38:10] in a different yet similarly empowering way,

[38:13] like for years and just didn't make a big,

[38:16] just yeah, you're more productive now,

[38:18] use this and everyone adopts it.

[38:20] And the last thing I want to say,

[38:22] and that's why I think it's healthy.

[38:25] Part of this big debate level React

[38:28] started when someone made a joke

[38:31] about web dev Cody, his name is.

[38:33] He's intentionally I think likes to create some,

[38:37] stir some drama because it makes things change.

[38:40] I don't really agree with that.

[38:41] But anyway, he said, oh yeah, Laravel makes it easy

[38:45] to do a to-do app.

[38:46] And he showed like all the folders for the database

[38:48] and the seeder and the factories

[38:49] and the stuff that have a little bit to do.

[38:52] But it's like opening the node modules folder

[38:55] in the Next.js app or the .next thing

[38:57] that generates all the chunks.

[38:59] And anyway, and then Taylor Otwell,

[39:02] the creator of Laravel politely,

[39:04] but kind of firmly just corrected the whole discussion.

[39:08] And then Brian Florence jumped in and I was like,

[39:11] oh, this could go anyway.

[39:13] And the way it went is there probably right now actually,

[39:16] because it's Tuesday in the US,

[39:18] recording a podcast together to discuss

[39:20] like how different frameworks approach

[39:22] from a full stack front end, back end.

[39:24] And so remix, Ryan Florence and Taylor Otwell

[39:27] are on the podcast.

[39:29] And I think it's going to be an incredible discussion

[39:31] that I'm really looking forward to listen to.

[39:33] - That's awesome.

[39:34] Yeah.

[39:35] So like, you know, for the first time probably ever,

[39:37] it's not just people yelling at each other

[39:39] from different sides of a fence.

[39:41] People like this,

[39:42] it sounds like this is actually starting

[39:44] like real conversations and discussions

[39:46] and like, you know, creating great content

[39:48] where people can go and get educated.

[39:50] Like, you know, you mentioned Aaron Francis's

[39:52] really good breakdown video of React versus Laravel

[39:55] or, you know, comparing React.

[39:57] - And it's all following that kind of initial

[40:00] initial web dev Cody and Taylor

[40:03] and then Ryan Florence.

[40:05] It all kind of sparked this.

[40:07] But it's healthier than usually.

[40:09] And credit to Taylor because he could have just

[40:12] could have just dunked on the thing

[40:14] and showed his Lamborghini,

[40:15] which he ended up doing in a different thread.

[40:18] But he said very clearly that Laravel started on the back

[40:21] and is very aware that React and Next

[40:24] and Remix do amazing stuff in the front end

[40:26] and provides starter kits to embrace that.

[40:29] But he said, hey, you have to realize

[40:31] Laravel is a backend framework that moved

[40:33] to the front end full stack.

[40:35] And Next.js is the opposite.

[40:36] It's like a front end thing that tries to dig into there.

[40:39] And he said, I think we all trying to bridge

[40:42] that full thing and it's nice to see everyone

[40:44] trying in a different way.

[40:45] Like he brought it in a very pragmatic way

[40:48] where you could have just like showed the receipts

[40:50] because Laravel people have receipts, man.

[40:54] Yeah, absolutely.

[40:56] Yeah, it's good that, yeah,

[40:58] we're getting some good discussion

[40:59] rather than just big flexes.

[41:01] All right.

[41:02] We probably need to wrap this up

[41:04] because you've got 5 million jobs

[41:06] and you need to get to other things.

[41:08] But before we go, Simon,

[41:10] do you have a sick pick for me this week?

[41:12] Or are you going to, see,

[41:13] you either go one side or the other.

[41:14] Either you don't have a sick pick

[41:16] or you just have 12 sick picks

[41:18] and you drop them all at once.

[41:19] So we need to slowly drip feed them out

[41:22] rather than just dumping them all at once.

[41:24] Do you have one sick pick for me this week?

[41:27] I have even better.

[41:28] I have the reverse sick pick.

[41:30] I have a sick unpick.

[41:31] Sick do not pick.

[41:32] Oh, wow.

[41:33] Okay.

[41:34] A sick correction.

[41:35] I like it.

[41:36] Sick do not pick.

[41:38] And we don't have a choice living here,

[41:40] but it is called the NBN,

[41:42] National Broadband Network,

[41:44] which is the Australian internet.

[41:48] Do not pick the Australian internet.

[41:51] Right now is happening to me

[41:53] the thing that makes most people over the world

[41:55] that are web dev ecstatic.

[41:57] I am getting a free upgrade to NBN fiber

[42:01] to the premise.

[42:02] So this optic fiber is going to go

[42:04] into my wall socket in the house wall,

[42:06] which means I can have the state-of-the-art internet,

[42:10] except in Australia,

[42:14] the state-of-the-art internet

[42:16] that I'm being offered

[42:18] without shedding thousands of dollars per month

[42:20] on the enterprise level

[42:21] where it says schedule a demo for the pricing

[42:24] is 400 down, which is all right,

[42:28] and 80 up.

[42:30] So 80 megabits per second up

[42:33] would make the rest of the world.

[42:35] I know because I'm from Switzerland.

[42:38] It is not blazing fast by any means.

[42:42] And this costs $149 a month.

[42:45] And it is marketed for enterprises

[42:49] up to 16 staff doing UHD streaming in parallel.

[42:53] I was like, no, it's not.

[42:55] Like I couldn't do that stream

[42:57] with another 15 people

[42:58] doing their own streams in parallel.

[43:00] And so basically I'm upgrading

[43:03] just because it's a free upgrade.

[43:05] And with the end of financial year,

[43:07] they have the first six months discount

[43:09] on the new plan.

[43:10] So I pay the same amount,

[43:11] which is a hundred bucks per month.

[43:13] But I have access to bigger and faster

[43:17] and the latency is going to be a bit smaller.

[43:19] But it's still so bad and so expensive

[43:22] compared to most of the world.

[43:24] Thailand, like there's so many places

[43:26] that you imagine the infrastructure

[43:28] would be harder to get to

[43:29] that is so much better than here.

[43:31] And it is an anti do not pick

[43:33] because yesterday from 8 a.m. to 12

[43:37] was the window for the NBN person to come.

[43:40] They were like, be at home.

[43:41] Make sure you're here.

[43:42] You ready to you have moved the furniture

[43:44] in front of the whole socket.

[43:46] I've done all this.

[43:47] I have three dogs.

[43:48] So every time they back, I'm like, yeah,

[43:50] the guy's here, let's go.

[43:51] And I walk and it's just a leaf

[43:53] that had fallen from a tree.

[43:55] False alarms after false alarm.

[43:58] And now they have rescheduled this afternoon

[44:00] from 4 to 8 p.m.

[44:02] I have genuinely zero trust

[44:05] or faith that it will happen.

[44:06] So, OK, 8 to 12.

[44:08] And at 1 p.m. yesterday,

[44:10] so an hour after the window,

[44:11] I get a text message saying

[44:13] your appointment is rescheduled

[44:15] due to the lack of technicians.

[44:18] It's like, how do you book an appointment

[44:20] and realize one hour later?

[44:21] Oh, actually, we don't have anyone.

[44:22] Sorry.

[44:23] Yeah.

[44:24] So and I was supposed to do

[44:27] a live remote meetup talk for CGS

[44:30] tonight at 6 or 7 p.m.

[44:33] The meetup ended up being canceled

[44:35] for other various reasons.

[44:37] But I contacted the organizer

[44:40] and I was like, dude, I'm freaking out.

[44:42] Like, there's going to be someone

[44:44] drilling holes and changing the NBN.

[44:46] It might cut off and there's dogs.

[44:47] They're going to go crazy at 7 p.m.

[44:49] There's kids, there's my family in-laws.

[44:51] I was like, this is not great.

[44:54] At least now I don't have to worry

[44:55] about this talk.

[44:56] But I almost guarantee that tonight

[44:59] I will tweet saying the NBN canceled

[45:01] on me again.

[45:02] I don't have any faith.

[45:03] So it's expensive.

[45:04] It's hard to organize.

[45:07] And the most frustrating bit is my house

[45:10] is capable of doing the ridiculous

[45:13] 1,000 down, 1,000 up.

[45:15] But it's priced at like 6.99 or 9.

[45:19] It's like enterprise tier.

[45:21] You need to run a business

[45:23] that makes serious money off the Internet,

[45:25] which maybe I do, actually.

[45:28] But it's...

[45:30] Once we get people to sponsor the NAVBA,

[45:32] it'll be a no-brainer.

[45:33] Look, I got to read something.

[45:35] I shared this in the CanSida epic web Slack.

[45:39] And I said, oh, I'm upgrading,

[45:40] but I should be more excited than I am.

[45:42] And I showed the pricing tiers

[45:44] and the speed and stuff.

[45:48] And Taylor Bell, who works at Egghead,

[45:52] said to me, I have 1,000 down,

[45:54] 1,000 up for $65,

[45:56] but I don't live as close to the beach.

[45:59] So yeah, further away from the beach.

[46:01] But the one gig down, one gig up for 60.

[46:04] And most of the world is in that range.

[46:07] And here, if you want that,

[46:08] it's almost $1,000.

[46:10] And also, it comes with these typical evening speeds.

[46:14] Like, it's still going to choke

[46:16] when people use Internet or stream Netflix,

[46:18] which people do with broadband NBN.

[46:22] It's a mess, man.

[46:23] The Internet is a mess.

[46:25] It is a mess.

[46:27] And you'll be glad to hear

[46:28] that at least you've got one up on me

[46:30] because I paid for this upgrade a couple of years ago

[46:35] before it was opted for free

[46:37] because my Internet was so unusable.

[46:40] And when I moved to doing content creation from home,

[46:45] I needed an Internet connection that was stable.

[46:49] So I think it cost us like $3,500

[46:53] for them to dig up our driveway

[46:57] and run all the cable underground.

[47:00] But yes, I am very much regretting that decision.

[47:04] Yeah, I hit the same problem.

[47:06] We paid heaps of money to upgrade it.

[47:08] And then I looked at the plans, and I'm like,

[47:10] "Well, I'm still going to be on a better plan than I was on."

[47:14] It's still going to make my--

[47:17] It's going to be the difference

[47:18] between being able to do my job

[47:19] and not being able to do my job.

[47:21] But if I wanted to actually benefit

[47:24] from the technology that we've just installed

[47:26] and paid to install,

[47:27] then yeah, it's going to be like $1,000 a month

[47:30] or just ludicrously expensive

[47:33] to be able to actually get decent speeds

[47:36] that are just like the base level

[47:39] for the rest of the world.

[47:41] There's even a close.

[47:43] You can look at every single provider,

[47:45] Aussie Broadband, and there's so many.

[47:48] They have family, normal, personal tier,

[47:51] and then business tier.

[47:52] And if you want a business tier,

[47:54] you need an ABN,

[47:55] which is an Australian business number.

[47:57] You need to be a registered business.

[47:59] I am a sole trader,

[48:00] and I'm registered as an ABN,

[48:01] so I actually can tap into this.

[48:04] But most personal stuff is capped to ridiculous.

[48:08] The fastest that you throw all your money

[48:10] as a personal consumer at is 40 megabits up.

[48:14] 140, that's the clamp in the countrywide.

[48:17] And if you don't have a business and you're like,

[48:19] "But I like gaming or I like watching movies."

[48:22] Well, too bad.

[48:23] Live streaming at 40 is like you're using all of it

[48:26] and you're hoping for the best.

[48:28] And then because I'm business,

[48:30] I can go all the way to the bigger tiers

[48:32] just because I registered my ABN.

[48:35] But you can see so many.

[48:39] I never understood that thing

[48:40] that gamers were joking about how hard it is

[48:42] to play games from Australia.

[48:44] But because of the geographical location,

[48:46] the latency is way bigger,

[48:48] and then the upstream upload thing is so low

[48:51] that every game you play is kind of lagging

[48:54] and you're delayed and stuff.

[48:56] And in a way, live streaming or Zoom calls is the same.

[48:59] I'm talking to John here,

[49:00] so we have a pretty decent latency.

[49:01] But every time when I did my workshop

[49:03] with people from around the world,

[49:05] there's this very noticeable one or two seconds delay

[49:08] that we all keep talking over each other.

[49:11] So we have a crappy time zone, a crappy internet,

[49:15] a crappy hot weather.

[49:18] I just realized I'm playing the DevRel stuff in hard mode.

[49:22] Very, very hard mode.

[49:23] Snowfields.

[49:24] Snowfields that barely have snow and it's just ice.

[49:27] We have very nice beaches.

[49:28] Very nice beaches.

[49:29] And very clean air.

[49:32] But you know what?

[49:33] I've seen Aaron Francis do this incredible reaction video.

[49:37] Like the way he did it was so tactful,

[49:39] but there's that beef drama, which is not.

[49:42] It's just a conversation starting between React Laravel

[49:45] and the to-do apps.

[49:47] And I discovered this tweet in the morning

[49:49] alongside Aaron's video that he took the screenshot

[49:52] of the tweet for the thumbnail

[49:53] and he had this really well-polished video.

[49:55] And I was like, I am aware of the timing of a video.

[50:00] It's like a joke.

[50:01] I said to him, if the timing is right, it hits.

[50:03] And if you do the same joke three or four seconds later,

[50:07] it just completely flops.

[50:09] And I realized if I want to be capitalizing

[50:12] on there's something happening in the industry,

[50:14] if I do really quick video now, it's going to go crazy

[50:17] because everyone's going to include it in the conversation.

[50:20] But then every time I see something happening,

[50:22] I look at the tweet and it says like 17 hours ago

[50:25] because it was before I just went to bed

[50:28] and I don't sleep 17 hours.

[50:30] But it's so much harder to be the travel

[50:34] to go to a conference.

[50:35] Everything is so hard from Australia.

[50:37] Every now and then, I might become successful

[50:40] with the Epic Web Courses,

[50:41] but it's so hard to be a dev role

[50:44] that goes to conferences

[50:45] and that rides on the moment of the industry

[50:48] and the little trends.

[50:50] And I think it's called trend jacking.

[50:52] Like you find something trending

[50:54] and you're like, oh, let's write this.

[50:56] It's almost impossible.

[50:57] And then you add crappy expensive internets

[50:59] to the mix and you're like, come on.

[51:02] What are we doing?

[51:04] - Yeah.

[51:05] We just need a proper tech hub here in Australia.

[51:08] The problem is that like Australia has a good tech scene

[51:12] and like a big, a lot of developers

[51:17] and a lot of companies,

[51:18] but all of them are trying to market to America

[51:22] or like there are a couple that,

[51:24] like the real estate company of Australia

[51:26] and the car listing company of Australia,

[51:29] but all of the other companies

[51:30] that just build general products

[51:32] all try to market towards the US

[51:37] 'cause that's where the majority of people

[51:39] spend money on tech.

[51:40] - This is why, by the way,

[51:42] we've chosen to record at nine morning

[51:45] instead of saying, oh, let's record at midnight

[51:47] so the San Francisco can watch our live stream,

[51:49] the NAV bars.

[51:50] No, we need to develop a community.

[51:52] There is a community,

[51:53] but we need to do stuff for them

[51:55] and make other people want to come here

[51:57] instead of making it hard.

[52:00] - And Simon gave you 10 reasons to never come here.

[52:02] So we're not doing a very good job.

[52:06] - My do not speak, do not speak was...

[52:10] - It kind of turned into do not pick Australia

[52:12] rather than the do not pick that it started as.

[52:15] - But I work for an Australian company,

[52:17] Thinkmill,

[52:18] and part of the pleasure

[52:20] is to have colleagues in my time.
