## Episode Summary

In this episode of The NavBar, hosts John and Simon dive deep into their video editing workflows for creating educational content. They discuss the challenges of editing long-form videos and share their strategies for improving efficiency and quality. The conversation covers topics like removing silences, syncing multiple video sources, and using AI tools to streamline the editing process. They also touch on the importance of engaging viewers in the first 30 seconds of a video and how their editing techniques have evolved over time. The hosts draw parallels between video editing and web development, highlighting how both benefit from iterative processes and polishing. They conclude by discussing their "sick picks" - a ceiling fan for Simon and the game Baldur's Gate 3 for John.

## Chapters

### 00:00 - Introduction and Context

The hosts introduce the topic of video editing and provide context for their discussion. This chapter sets the stage for the conversation, explaining that both hosts have recently been working on creating educational video content. They touch on the challenges of producing multiple videos in a short timeframe and the importance of developing an efficient workflow. The hosts also mention how their processes have evolved since they last discussed this topic on the podcast.

### 04:18 - Simon's Video Editing Process

Simon details his three-pass editing technique and the tools he uses. Simon breaks down his video editing process into three main passes. He explains how he uses Ecamm Live for recording and DaVinci Resolve for editing. Simon describes his first pass, which involves syncing audio and video, rough cutting, and removing mistakes. He then details his second pass, where he focuses on choosing between camera and screen recording views. Finally, he discusses his third pass, which involves fine-tuning and polishing the edit.

### 28:57 - John's Editing Workflow and AI Tools

John shares his editing process and discusses the use of AI tools in video editing. John describes his similar multi-pass editing approach and how he's been experimenting with AI tools to streamline the process. He talks about using tools like Descript and Gling.ai to automatically remove silences and identify repeated phrases. The hosts discuss the benefits and limitations of these AI tools, and how they integrate them into their workflows.

### 54:29 - Engaging Viewers and YouTube Strategies

The hosts discuss techniques for engaging viewers and optimizing videos for YouTube. This chapter covers the importance of the first 30 seconds of a video in capturing viewer attention. The hosts talk about using music, transitions, and dynamic editing to create an engaging intro. They also discuss YouTube analytics and how understanding viewer behavior can inform editing decisions. The conversation touches on the balance between creating "hype" and delivering valuable content.

### 75:50 - Parallels Between Video Editing and Web Development

Simon draws comparisons between his video editing process and his approach to web development. Simon explains how his video editing workflow has influenced his approach to web development, particularly when using Tailwind CSS. He describes how he applies the concept of multiple passes - from rough layout to polished design - in both video editing and web development. The hosts discuss the benefits of this iterative approach and how it allows for more flexibility and efficiency in both domains.

### 109:35 - Wrap-up and "Sick Picks"

The hosts conclude the episode and share their "sick picks" of the week. In this final chapter, Simon and John wrap up their discussion on video editing. They then move on to their "sick picks" segment, where Simon recommends a new ceiling fan he installed, and John recommends the video game Baldur's Gate 3. They briefly discuss the game's co-op features and how it relates to their personal interests and time constraints.

## Transcript

[00:00] Hello, we are live, sorry we're late yet again, everybody this time.

[00:05] I mean, I was a little bit late, but I wasn't as late as this.

[00:08] Simon and I were just having a great engaging conversation like we generally

[00:12] do before we hit record on the podcast.

[00:13] So now the podcast is going to be super dull where we're not, we're

[00:16] not really going to have any talk about it.

[00:18] So thank you so much for listening to this week's episode of the NavBar

[00:24] and we'll see you next week.

[00:25] Bye.

[00:26] We have three people live, which is awesome.

[00:29] Before, or as we start off, sorry for delaying so much for all of the people

[00:36] that actually are joining us live.

[00:37] That's awesome.

[00:38] I want to say something that hopefully will help people that are, it kind of,

[00:43] that we, today we are going to talk about how we go about creating a, I don't want

[00:49] to use the word content because it makes me more and more kind of like cringe.

[00:54] Content is a very, it's a very loaded content.

[00:57] Like this is hot content.

[01:00] Like this, so how we create videos and educational materials.

[01:06] And on that note, before we start, I just want to make one observation about me.

[01:11] We started this podcast with John two years, one year ago, and the first few

[01:16] weeks, the night before I was really nervous and I was like, Oh my God, we

[01:20] have a podcast and then I started sleeping.

[01:23] Okay.

[01:23] But in the morning I was like, Oh crap, this is today's the podcast.

[01:27] I was nervous.

[01:27] And then I got to a point where I was like, Oh, it's in half an

[01:30] hour and I'm sort of okay about it.

[01:33] And now I've flipped the other side where I wake up on Wednesday and I'm

[01:37] like, yes, this is podcast day.

[01:39] And nothing is prepared.

[01:41] And I just 10 minutes before it starts, I'm with the kids at home and I'm

[01:45] absolutely no problem that just rock up here and turn my lights on and I'm

[01:50] ready to go live and I'm looking forward.

[01:51] So if you're creating materials, educational materials, and you feel

[01:58] pressure, just know it never goes completely away, but there's ways to

[02:01] channel it into a positive, um, and for me, it's really like, now it's like,

[02:05] I'm looking forward to catch up with you every week and before I already did

[02:10] that, but the, the stress of like delivering a good podcast and all that

[02:13] was, was really putting stress on it.

[02:17] And now there's like zero stress at all.

[02:19] And if you don't like it, you can change, but I think it also brings a more

[02:25] natural delivery and a fun delivery.

[02:26] Yeah.

[02:27] And you know, we, we used to really like, um, plan these things really,

[02:32] really strictly, like there was, well, yeah, there was a script.

[02:35] Like when we started doing this, there was actually a script to the podcast

[02:38] and we had like different colors for the different sections we were going to

[02:41] talk about, but it was like, you know, it might've just been dot points, but it

[02:44] was like a whole massive page of, of dot points that we were going to cover.

[02:48] Um, whereas now we've realized it's just fun to catch up and have a conversation

[02:52] and we have a couple of things we can talk about, but we don't necessarily

[02:55] have to, and yeah, I feel the same.

[02:57] I was feeling like I used to feel really, really nervous.

[02:58] I used to feel like even the days before I was like, Oh, we need to prepare.

[03:02] We need to have this, like, I need to think of something that

[03:05] I can say in the podcast.

[03:06] Um, and yeah, and, and now I just, we just turn up and like, I've become so relaxed.

[03:12] I just turned up like 10 minutes late.

[03:14] This is it.

[03:16] This is too, too relaxed.

[03:17] Now I get to relax.

[03:18] Relax.

[03:19] You need to add a little bit of stress, mix in a little bit

[03:21] of stress to the situation.

[03:23] Quick side, quick side note.

[03:24] We are not talking about basketball, but I'm wearing manly basketball and

[03:28] he's wearing West Melbourne Phoenix.

[03:30] Is it Southeast?

[03:31] Southeast Melbourne Phoenix.

[03:34] West Southeast.

[03:35] Two basketball clubs, uh, in Australia.

[03:39] Yeah.

[03:40] Local basketball clubs.

[03:41] How have you been?

[03:43] Yeah.

[03:44] Mine is very, it doesn't have a big NBL team.

[03:47] It's like a Northern Beaches in Sydney.

[03:50] It's like a local club, but it has NBL one, which is the level under.

[03:54] Nice.

[03:56] All right.

[03:57] I'm starting the podcast now.

[03:59] Welcome to the Nav Bar.

[04:01] Simon, how have you been?

[04:03] I am good.

[04:04] I am just very upset that you always want to cut the little

[04:07] chit chat before the podcast, which I think is part of it.

[04:10] And people would enjoy.

[04:11] Yeah.

[04:12] I don't like you guys who are listening only get a very small, like narrow

[04:16] band of what the podcast actually is.

[04:18] So the way that like a normal week works is that Simon and I start our,

[04:23] our, our catch up and we're not live.

[04:25] And then we end up talking for like half an hour, 45 minutes, uh, because

[04:30] we just love talking to each other.

[04:31] And then we're like, all right, cool.

[04:32] We should go live.

[04:33] And then we have a little bit of, uh, a little bit of time where we're just

[04:36] chatting and talking to, to the people who are joining us live on YouTube.

[04:40] And then eventually we're like, all right, cool.

[04:42] Let's start the podcast.

[04:43] Then you get the audio version, but then you get all of that in reverse.

[04:46] At the end, like we end the audio podcast and then sometimes we hang around for a

[04:50] little bit on the live broadcast and then we end up having like another, usually

[04:55] it's longer than the podcast that we end up chatting at the end while we're trying

[04:59] to quickly wrap it up and like, get back to all of the things that we need to do.

[05:02] We just love talking to each other.

[05:04] It's good that we run a.

[05:05] I don't know what's happening.

[05:07] I've got an extra scene in the back.

[05:09] Hello, I've messed up there.

[05:11] Layering.

[05:13] If you're not watching the video, if you're not joining us live, Simon

[05:15] has somehow layered a version of himself as our background and

[05:19] then us overlaid on top of that.

[05:21] So lots of Simon in this episode.

[05:23] It's excellent.

[05:24] I don't know what to do anymore.

[05:27] Keep, let's talk and I'll work it out.

[05:29] Can I put just you for a while?

[05:31] Okay.

[05:32] Well, I was just about to ask you a question, but I guess I'll, uh, I'll jump

[05:36] into me, what have I been doing this week?

[05:38] Um, I fixed our dishwasher.

[05:41] I'm so proud of this.

[05:42] We, our dishwasher broke.

[05:44] There was a display, it displayed an error code and I was really, really

[05:50] upset that, that we had to hand wash dishes.

[05:52] I know this is such like a stupid thing to complain about, but when you have

[05:55] like kids and you've got full-time work and you've got a podcast on the side

[06:01] and you've got all of these things going on, uh, when you have to like also

[06:05] factor in hand-washing all of the dishes, it just broke me.

[06:09] I felt like I just couldn't, I couldn't face having to hand wash

[06:13] these dishes.

[06:14] So we got someone to come out to look at it, um, and, and try and repair it.

[06:19] Um, and before they had come out, we had basically run through diagnosing

[06:23] what we thought the problem was, which was to flush out the filters.

[06:25] Um, and the person came out and they looked at it and they were like, yep,

[06:29] these filters look clean.

[06:31] That's all I can do.

[06:32] Here's a $200 bill.

[06:34] Thank you.

[06:34] Uh, and I was, I was so frustrated and his attitude was basically like, yeah,

[06:40] we could swap this other part that could be related, but it's probably

[06:43] not going to fix it because it's a 10 year old dishwasher.

[06:46] And so you should just buy a new dishwasher.

[06:48] And I was like, there's this problem will be one small, small

[06:53] thing, like one component.

[06:55] And then if we just chuck this whole thing in landfill, like if everyone

[06:59] has that attitude, like it's, it's just awful, like replace the small

[07:04] piece that needs to be replaced and then using the dishwasher

[07:07] probably for another 10 years.

[07:09] Uh, and so after he left, I did some more research and I was fueled by.

[07:13] Anger and frustration and contempt for, for, uh, them charging me $200 to

[07:19] just basically tell me that I shouldn't bother fixing it and she'd get a new one.

[07:23] Anyway, ended up finding the part that, um, I was pretty sure needed to be replaced

[07:28] and then, uh, ordered it from the, uh, the company's website from their parts

[07:33] website and got the part back to the house and had installed it and repaired

[07:39] the dishwasher before they even sent me a quote for what the, like the part

[07:44] that they said probably wouldn't even fix it, which did fix it.

[07:47] Uh, and so I feel fantastic about defeating the evil dishwasher repair

[07:55] company, whose job it is to like.

[07:57] Fix these things and keep these things alive so that people don't just go out

[08:01] and buy another, like thousand dollars or $2,000, whatever, uh, white goods

[08:07] appliance that also doesn't need to exist while this one just gets chucked in landfill.

[08:11] So it's like this biggest appliance in your house, basically.

[08:17] The fridge is taller, but the washing machine is like, exactly.

[08:21] And even if you just think about like, even just the metal in this, like

[08:24] there's so much stuff in this big box that just gets chucked in the bin.

[08:30] Yep.

[08:31] Like, ah, yeah.

[08:32] All right.

[08:33] There's, there's my rant about the state of the world back in my day,

[08:38] we used to fix our appliances.

[08:40] And now that Simon's back, I'd love to hear about, uh, you have been on,

[08:46] on a basketball tour recently, right?

[08:48] Oh yes.

[08:49] Yes.

[08:49] Yeah.

[08:51] To make it a real tech podcast.

[08:53] Um, so last week was the, there's a thing called PSSA pro, uh,

[09:00] public, no private, no primary, primary school sports association.

[09:05] So kids up to age 11 ish, when they go to year six is primary school in Australia.

[09:11] And, uh, you can participate to this event before, but obviously

[09:15] you compete with the year six kids.

[09:17] So there was a few year five, uh, like superstars in, but what happened is.

[09:23] My son made the local school basketball team.

[09:27] And then this team tries for the P double S a, uh, regional against other kids.

[09:33] There's a 20, 50 people from the little district where you live.

[09:36] And then he made that team and then they do the region regional stuff.

[09:41] So, um, in our case, that was like the region from Coffs Harbor to

[09:45] Ballina, which is about two hours drive stretch, and he made that team.

[09:48] And then the next round was the North coast, which is.

[09:51] Port Macquarie to Queensland, which is now like a, a good six

[09:55] hour stretch of coasts, if you drive and inland also.

[09:58] And he made that team again, which means he made the final, uh, final bus, not

[10:03] really the final bus, but he, he made the state team, which he's going to

[10:07] compete other against other new South Wales, uh, state teams for the state

[10:13] championships, and that was a whole week, uh, competition.

[10:17] So we represented the North coast and then there's the Sydney and South

[10:21] coast and Western New South Wales, and basically the whole state has little.

[10:26] Defined regions with a team of 10 players that represent them.

[10:30] And my son was in the North coast one, which is, it's pretty cool.

[10:33] Like the, I know Australia is big and stretched, but it's, it's a region

[10:37] that is maybe five times bigger than Switzerland, my country of origin.

[10:42] And he made the 10 players representing that team, uh, which is pretty cool.

[10:47] That's awesome.

[10:48] So I was down in Newcastle, which is a couple of hours North of Sydney for that

[10:53] tournament.

[10:53] And it was, I took a whole week holiday, no work.

[10:57] Uh, I wanted to be able to be completely present because it's my son and it's

[11:02] basketball and it's all my life.

[11:03] And I was like, I didn't coach him.

[11:06] He took a week off the NASBA guys.

[11:07] You got to understand this was really, really important to Simon.

[11:10] Yeah, I considered that one.

[11:13] I considered joining from the sideline, showing the game, but yeah, that was,

[11:17] that was a great tournament.

[11:19] Uh, you, you realize very quickly that any team that has the word Sydney in it

[11:25] is going to be an absolute powerhouse because there's 6 million people living

[11:31] in Sydney.

[11:31] Uh, Sydney has Sydney North, Sydney West, Sydney South, but still every one of

[11:36] these group has more people, more infrastructure, more personal trainers,

[11:41] more money to, to deploy into development, player development.

[11:46] So unsurprisingly, we, North coast is actually quite competitive.

[11:50] We, we won most games against other regional places like surf, surf coast

[11:56] and a bit inland, but we played, uh, three different Sydney based teams and

[12:01] they roasted us by quite a bit.

[12:03] Actually we were, we were competitive, but they still ended like basketball is

[12:08] one of these sports where good teams go on mini runs where they steal the ball,

[12:12] score, steal the ball again, score again, timeout.

[12:14] And, uh, they, they did that to us multiple times.

[12:17] So you end up with like losing by 20 or 30, even if the game feels close.

[12:21] But that was a great experience.

[12:23] And, uh, um, at the end of the week, I knew from the start, my son would not

[12:28] make it because of his height.

[12:31] He's an elite player for his age, but he's, he's hasn't hit that puberty, big

[12:37] growth, whatever that some kids in the tournament, clearly some of them were by

[12:41] far taller than me, who's like a 43 year old, six foot adult, five foot 11.

[12:46] Okay.

[12:46] But, um, there's some six plus two, six, three dudes.

[12:51] Uh, and, um, so out of all these teams, that was 140 players, I think,

[12:57] because there's 14 teams of 10, uh, National coaches, like from the state

[13:04] coaches, New South Wales coaches looked at the games for the whole week and

[13:07] picked 10 players of the whole state to go to the next level, which is like the

[13:12] nationals, which happened on the Gold Coast, which is two hours drive from where

[13:16] we live.

[13:16] So my son was pretty like, Oh, maybe I'll make it.

[13:20] And I was pretty clear.

[13:21] I was like, dude, like, even if you play your best week of basketball, like, I

[13:25] don't think there's much of a chance just because of the, the size and stuff.

[13:30] And, uh, it turns out that my son is a point guard, which is usually the

[13:33] shortest player, but fast and good court vision.

[13:36] And the point guard that got selected is as tall as me or just a bit shorter.

[13:41] And then it goes up from there.

[13:42] So the prediction was kind of, um, kind of correct.

[13:46] It's like a very big, strong teams.

[13:48] Uh, so yeah, so these 10 players will now in a few weeks go play against

[13:54] Queensland and Western Australia and Northern territory.

[13:57] And yeah, it's super cool.

[13:58] And that is all part of the school system.

[14:01] So, and it's nothing to do with clubs and other things like manly or the,

[14:06] my son plays for Coffs Harbour sons.

[14:08] This one is like the school private and public schools, primary schools.

[14:13] Uh, and then there's another one for the secondary school, but

[14:16] it's obviously year 11, 12.

[14:18] So again, if you're a absolute superstar, you could be in year seven and play

[14:25] with like 17 year old boys, buddy.

[14:27] I think you got to wait a few more years to make that team again.

[14:31] So it's, yeah, it's good opportunity and I'm super happy.

[14:34] I was part of it fully.

[14:35] Yeah.

[14:35] That sounds great.

[14:36] And like, yeah, for him to get that far at his height, like imagine what's going to

[14:40] happen when he does like shoot up and become a super tall, I think maybe he will

[14:47] be playing for one of the NBL teams or one of the, uh, yeah, bigger clubs.

[14:52] Yeah.

[14:53] So that's what I told him.

[14:54] I said, uh, you're not going to make the team, but I've, I've watched you this week

[14:59] play and while there's a new South Wales guy with the clipboard in the corner, and

[15:03] I've seen like little head nods and there's a little bit, I'm pretty sure there's a

[15:07] circle, like, like, Hey, let's, let's watch this space here.

[15:11] This guy's got some pretty good skills.

[15:13] Yeah.

[15:14] He's a good player.

[15:15] I'm, I'm very biased obviously, but he's got the factor of like, uh, competitive

[15:22] and speed and talent and pretty cool.

[15:25] Awesome.

[15:26] All right.

[15:27] And to bring it back to tech things.

[15:28] All right.

[15:29] We'll talk about some tech things.

[15:30] So there were, yeah, there's, uh, something that we've, we've wanted to talk about

[15:36] for a while is that both of our like processes in recording content, uh, or

[15:41] not, not content, that's a loaded term.

[15:44] What are we calling it?

[15:45] Educational materials.

[15:47] Educational materials, creating educational materials.

[15:50] Videos, creating videos.

[15:53] Uh, both of us have, have probably changed our process quite a lot since the last

[15:57] time we did an episode on this, uh, Simon has recently been exploring some very

[16:02] interesting stuff, which I would love to hear about.

[16:04] So Simon, what is your high level process at the moment for recording videos?

[16:10] All right.

[16:11] So I, um, I haven't really changed the tools that I use.

[16:15] I've just refined my approach, but for me, the biggest struggle is always come

[16:21] up with the design and the idea and the story, uh, but to bring it back to what

[16:27] I've done the week before my basketball tournament, uh, I, I had all of that done.

[16:32] I, I did this live workshops, uh, with Epic web and it's a series of problem

[16:38] solution, and it's very defined.

[16:41] This is the starting code.

[16:42] This is the end code.

[16:42] This is the challenge.

[16:44] And so I had all these, uh, progression of exercise done already that I've

[16:48] delivered in, in live, not in person.

[16:51] It's on zoom, but like I've taught it's life to an audience.

[16:55] And the next step was to produce a video progression of the same thing.

[16:59] So I had all the, for me, that's all the hard part that takes so much time and

[17:04] then becomes the fun, but also time consuming part to record and edit the

[17:10] videos, but at least I'm not like spinning my wheels on how, what should I teach here?

[17:15] What's the design looking like?

[17:16] Who do I need the help from?

[17:18] So I had 71 videos segments.

[17:22] Oh my goodness.

[17:24] That is a lot.

[17:24] Most of them are short.

[17:26] Uh, but especially the problem introduction.

[17:29] I'm like, Hey, here's where we're at.

[17:31] We want to add this little effect on hover, uh, read the instruction.

[17:35] Here's a link to help you.

[17:37] Good luck.

[17:37] And sometimes it's like 40 seconds segment, but then the

[17:41] solution is me walking through.

[17:42] So these typically are like anything between two and 10, 15 minutes sometimes.

[17:48] Now, if you've edited a 15 minutes YouTube video, you know, by itself, it

[17:51] can take a couple of hours easily.

[17:53] So I'm going to break down the process.

[17:56] And then my discoveries, cause I've done 71 of them while

[18:00] working full-time two weeks ago.

[18:02] I do not recommend doing that more than a week because I didn't sleep much.

[18:07] I didn't exercise at all.

[18:08] And I barely saw my family, but it, it was a window for me of, I have to do

[18:13] this push because then I go to the basketball week and if I start editing

[18:17] during the games, it's going to be a mess and then I'm lose my momentum.

[18:20] So I set myself to do it and I did it.

[18:22] So here's how I did it.

[18:24] Now we can finally talk.

[18:26] That was the context.

[18:28] Time to start the podcast.

[18:30] Let's go.

[18:30] Welcome to the nav bar.

[18:32] Step one is I verify because I got burnt before that I'm having the right audio

[18:40] and camera and screen recording settings.

[18:42] I use the same software that we use now to stream this, which is called Ecamm Live.

[18:48] It's a paid product and it's only Mac.

[18:50] So might not be your cup of tea, but it's essentially what OBS also does.

[18:55] Just you, you pay money and you get really good ergonomics and, uh, nice

[19:00] additions, uh, in exchange for the money you pay, you can do it with

[19:04] OBS or QuickTime or whatever.

[19:06] So I record my screen and it records my camera and my microphone.

[19:11] And I press record, like I prepare my codes.

[19:15] I have my notes on the side screen and then I hit record.

[19:17] And I never stop it.

[19:18] And I got better over time.

[19:20] When you hit record, you're going to mess up the first segment 10, 20 times.

[19:24] But if you live, when I teach the live, um, workshop, I never got stuck on the intro.

[19:32] I was like, Hey, let me restart.

[19:33] Let me rest.

[19:33] You have an audience.

[19:35] So I convinced myself that I'm live.

[19:36] And I'm just like, I started telling my head, uh, okay, that's the end of the break.

[19:42] We're going to start.

[19:42] And I press record.

[19:44] And I literally pretend that I'm delivering the workshop because I'm

[19:46] trying to, the videos should represent as much as possible, the real in-person

[19:52] delivery.

[19:52] So basically convinced me to like, I'm live now I've pressed record, like I've

[19:58] pressed go live.

[19:58] And I go through it very naturally, actually, just by tricking me like this.

[20:02] And I record the whole segment until I'm done.

[20:05] And then I hit stop.

[20:07] And then what I typically do, because I was doing so many videos is I, instead

[20:13] of recording one and editing one, uh, because of recording conditions, the room

[20:18] temperature, the light, everything, I tried to record as much as I could in one

[20:22] block until I, something takes precedence like work or family or open window, like

[20:29] some need, need some oxygen in here.

[20:31] Get rid of the CO2, just to quickly go back just, just before you keep going on

[20:36] just to, uh, to, to maybe make it clear to people who don't create content in

[20:40] full time, uh, the alternative to, to recording all of this in a natural way.

[20:44] The reason Simon saying that is usually, uh, I think both of us try to get these

[20:49] like absolutely perfect takes of every single thing we say throughout an entire

[20:54] video.

[20:54] And so we will say like basically one sentence or maybe like a paragraph at a

[21:00] time, and then we'll stop and wait a sec and then do the next bit and then stop

[21:04] and wait a sec.

[21:05] And anytime we mess up, if we say, say something incorrectly or, um, you know,

[21:11] a trip over a word or whatever, uh, we just take it back to the start of that

[21:15] sentence and go again.

[21:16] So when you get to the editing process, uh, like it's super fast to edit all of

[21:22] those bits out, but because you're going for that like level of perfection, there's

[21:27] a heap of editing that you need to do.

[21:29] And you need to like, you know, you're basically, um, you know, cutting up every,

[21:35] every sentence in the entire video.

[21:37] And so like Simon said, like a 10 minute video that you're trying to do for

[21:41] YouTube could take like hours of recording and could take hours of editing.

[21:46] Um, because you just keep redoing things until you have it perfect.

[21:51] And so it sounds like your process was to avoid that as much as possible, given you

[21:56] had to create 70 plus videos.

[21:58] Um, and so you were trying to create more of an in-person thing where you can't go

[22:03] back and you can't perfect it.

[22:04] You can't like, if you mess up a word, you just, you just roll forward or you

[22:08] correct the word, but keep going.

[22:09] Um, which I imagine would make the editing process like way simpler because then

[22:16] you're essentially just like cutting off the start, cutting off the end, and then

[22:20] maybe doing like a couple of edits in the middle where you, where you really

[22:23] needed to take something out.

[22:24] That is the ideal world, which I am not in.

[22:31] The whole trick does for me is to be able to get past the first sentence because I

[22:36] would literally, and I know it's not just me, like I've seen so many.

[22:39] Yeah, no, that's definitely me as well.

[22:40] I have like an hour of the first sentence and then I have the rest of the video.

[22:44] Today we, today you get stuck in that loop because you just hit record.

[22:49] So the going live thing gets me past that first sentence, but then I still go for

[22:54] the, I, if I, if I say something wrong, I just pause and I say it again, but I

[22:58] don't stop the recording.

[22:59] So there's still plenty of editing happening, but at least I unblock myself

[23:04] from the cold start basically.

[23:06] And when you do 71 videos, you don't want to get stuck 71 times at the intro where

[23:12] some of the videos are literally just the intro and not much else.

[23:14] So, so that trick kind of helped me start faster, but basically I record as many

[23:20] full segments as I can in one block.

[23:22] Uh, another lesson from life that taught me where I lost all the recordings that

[23:27] instantly after finishing one video, I drag it in a Dropbox folder and it uploads

[23:32] there.

[23:32] So if whatever happens, my computer burns or something, hopefully there's a backup

[23:38] somewhere.

[23:38] Yeah.

[23:39] Uh, I did another thing that's not really useful, but it's mentally useful.

[23:43] I had a notion to do, and then recorded columns with 71 in the to do and zero in

[23:48] the recorded and every three or four videos I would take like select multiple

[23:53] and drag them in the to do. And when you move like the, the done or recorded

[23:59] column grows, but also the other one shrinks and you can, you can, after a

[24:03] couple of days, you can see when you're about to reach halfway.

[24:05] And this is so mentally satisfying, even if like it's just a recording and then

[24:09] you're going to do the same for editing.

[24:11] Yeah.

[24:12] So I've done all these recordings and then at different times I would go and

[24:17] tackle the editing part.

[24:20] And this is, I think where there's interesting things to talk about.

[24:23] I have a three pass editing technique.

[24:27] Actually, I should record a video on my process because everyone's like, Oh,

[24:31] your videos are so polished.

[24:32] And sometimes you're on the side, sometimes you're full screen.

[24:34] How, what's your process?

[24:35] Here's my process for free on the podcast in your ears while you drive.

[24:40] As long as you subscribe to the podcast, hit that subscribe button right now.

[24:46] And then Simon will keep talking.

[24:48] I'll wait, I'm waiting hit.

[24:51] Okay.

[24:51] So I drag my camera face and the screen recording.

[25:00] They both have the same audio.

[25:01] That's maybe important.

[25:02] I record the same audio on both, even if it takes more storage.

[25:06] But what it does is I can, I can drag both in my editing software,

[25:10] which is DaVinci resolve, but you can use whatever you want.

[25:13] Uh, this process will likely be the same as long as you have multi track

[25:17] capabilities. So I have my video face and my screen, and then two audio tracks.

[25:23] And I select all of this and I right click and I go synchronize by waveform.

[25:28] That's why you need the audio similar.

[25:30] And why do I need that?

[25:32] Because sometimes there's a little latency.

[25:34] Like I just want my lips and the, the voice, like I want it to be perfectly

[25:39] sync, or maybe sometimes I started the screen recording later or whatever, like

[25:44] you can sync and it automatically lines them up for the whole recording.

[25:48] Once I've done that, I delete one of the audio files because I don't want two of

[25:51] them, but I know I have my camera and the screen in sync.

[25:55] And then that's where the magic trick, uh, that's what I do.

[25:59] Uh, I select both pay attention.

[26:02] This is the key moment.

[26:03] I P I select both the camera and the screen.

[26:06] And I changed the zoom level from a hundred percent to 0.66666.

[26:13] So two thirds, 66%, two thirds, then I moved the screen recording to the right

[26:20] by 640 pixels because of the resolution.

[26:24] And it puts it perfectly right aligned.

[26:26] And then I drag my camera.

[26:29] Uh, I literally eyeball it.

[26:31] I drag myself until I appear in the remaining space on the left.

[26:34] Uh, where it kind of feels balanced when my shoulders kind of fit the frame.

[26:39] And so that's, that's my like split view and I edit the entire video like this.

[26:44] And the reason is I can see both.

[26:46] So I'm like, I always kind of have a good idea of what, like, if you

[26:51] just edit the screen recording, you're like, Oh, I wonder if I should put my

[26:54] face next, but then you realize you like picking your nose while you talk.

[26:57] So you're like, it's no good.

[26:58] So I, here's, I have my face on the left, the screen on the right with

[27:06] a completely raw, uh, recording, and then the next step is like John said,

[27:11] I go through the whole video and I find the spots where I messed up.

[27:16] And I said six times the same sentence and I removed the first

[27:20] five and keep the fifth, the sixth one.

[27:22] And then I tried to remove the poses and the, uh, and, and all that stuff.

[27:27] And I, at this point, I basically go with my ears.

[27:30] I try to edit.

[27:31] So it sounds like a good delivery and I don't really care

[27:35] of what happens on the screen.

[27:37] So that's the first pass.

[27:38] Basically, I go left, right.

[27:39] And chop, chop, chop, chop.

[27:41] And it is literally for a 10 minute video.

[27:43] It's literally close to a thousand cuts.

[27:46] Like you say death by a thousand paper cuts.

[27:48] I sometimes takes a screenshot and tweet.

[27:51] You can see the timeline.

[27:52] This is like, like you're doing like a very fine zucchini slices.

[27:57] That's what it looks like.

[27:59] Um, any question on that first pass?

[28:02] Because that's, that's the first, uh, in the most time consuming

[28:06] part of the process, but it sets me up for the success later.

[28:11] So I think like, yeah, my process is very, very similar to this in that

[28:15] it's, um, like I record my camera separate from my screen.

[28:20] Uh, I make sure that I record both audio sources and then sync them up.

[28:24] Um, something that I've started doing in, in the section that you were just

[28:28] talking about is not even like listening through the first time, the first time

[28:33] because DaVinci resolve has really good tools for like, um, slicing where the

[28:37] play head is and then ripple deleting.

[28:40] So where you delete a chunk and then it pulls everything forward.

[28:43] Um, I go through like, not even listening, but just looking at the

[28:47] waveform and basically cutting out, manually cutting out all of the

[28:50] silences, um, which is kind of cool.

[28:52] Cause I can, I can do it.

[28:54] Like just without having my full focus on it.

[28:57] Like I can have some music on or a podcast or like be doing it while.

[29:01] Like sitting on the couch for the basketball game or something.

[29:04] Um, I can cut out all of these silences and then I've, I've got this like rough

[29:08] cut that's basically, um, like, because of the way that I deliver my content,

[29:12] it basically, uh, like I remove all of the silences.

[29:16] So it's like pretty much just me talking solidly for like 10 minutes, which is a

[29:21] pretty like standard YouTube, um, style of video.

[29:25] Um, and so I've found that like that process of going through and doing that

[29:28] kind of just like on autopilot without even actually listening or being engaged

[29:33] in, in what I'm doing makes it way easier when I come to the next layer, the next

[29:37] cut, because I can then just quickly listen to the start of each clip.

[29:41] And if I'm saying the same thing, then I know I made a mistake and I can

[29:44] just delete, um, that one before it.

[29:47] Yep.

[29:47] That's something else that I wanted to ask is the reason that I've even prompted

[29:50] all of this is I thought that you had changed this process slightly and that

[29:54] you had found a tool that could maybe do exactly what I just talked about.

[29:58] Automatically.

[29:59] What happened in the story here?

[30:01] Oh, you're telling a story.

[30:02] Oh, no, no, no, you have to say that you have to set the stage for the pain and

[30:07] the, the, the wasted time, and then you can see the value.

[30:11] Okay.

[30:11] Okay.

[30:12] Continue on with the pain.

[30:13] So I did this totally manually for every single video for 74 videos, 71 videos.

[30:18] Well, sort of like I've done a bunch of it, um, because you said what you said,

[30:24] I'm going to bring one thing straight away.

[30:25] Um, if you want to cut silences as what, what John was saying is like, you can

[30:30] visually see the way from without listening.

[30:32] Basically there's the, the audio track has little, little lines.

[30:37] The louder you speak, the bigger the lines are.

[30:38] And so a silence is just a complete empty middle line.

[30:42] And then every time you talk, it makes little waves.

[30:45] And so you can visually see, well, there's nothing here.

[30:47] I can cut before, after that, my friend.

[30:51] There are today right now, amazing tools that do it in one second.

[30:55] And I am surprised DaVinci resolve hasn't built that in, uh, one cool tool.

[31:00] It's not a subscription.

[31:02] It's a buy once forget forever.

[31:04] Uh, and I want to buy this.

[31:06] I haven't done it yet, but it seems amazing.

[31:09] It's called recuts.

[31:10] There's someone really active on Twitter.

[31:13] Uh, Dave said, yeah, I think I'm not sure of the name.

[31:15] Maybe I'm mixed up with someone, but it's a tool.

[31:18] We literally, you literally upload the audio or upload your files video.

[31:22] Or even if you have two of them, you upload your raw recordings and you can

[31:27] select how much padding you want, just like in CSS padding before and after the

[31:31] silence, otherwise it cuts like right when the sound starts and stops and it

[31:36] makes this very tick tock, like high pace, uh, intentionally zero pause between

[31:42] sentences cuts, which, uh, has value for some short videos, but you can also say,

[31:47] Hey, I want half a second or 0.8 seconds before and after, and then you go process

[31:53] and it goes, it removes all of stuff.

[31:55] Here's the video for downloads where I've done the work that John specifically

[32:01] described, find the silences and remove them.

[32:03] It does this in five seconds and you just drag the video in and pull it

[32:08] out and you've done that step.

[32:09] So that would be the first thing.

[32:12] So, so much time saved.

[32:15] Uh, yeah, like that, that even that process of not of doing that on, uh, on

[32:21] autopilot and not paying attention to it, it'll still take like, you know, probably

[32:26] half an hour, maybe longer, depending on how many times I've messed up in that

[32:29] video, but like, it still takes a decent chunk of time just sitting there and like,

[32:33] you're probably extremely likely to develop RSI from just doing the same

[32:39] repetitive task over and over for like, it's exactly the same hand movement.

[32:43] Like it's just moving the, in my case, a track pad, um, and then pressing like

[32:48] one of two keys to either make a slice where I am or to like ripple cut everything

[32:53] on the left.

[32:54] Um, and so like that, that is like, just so likely to cause RSI in the future.

[33:00] It's insane.

[33:01] Yeah.

[33:02] Uh, speaking of, uh, you can't see it on screen, but I have a MX master, the, the

[33:07] mouse that everyone raves about it.

[33:09] If you look at the profile, it's got, it's got this crazy shape, but your

[33:12] hand sits on it.

[33:13] Like if you sit on the rock instead of a flat mouse and the ergonomics saved because

[33:18] I was definitely getting this RSI stuff.

[33:21] Another tip on the topic.

[33:22] Um, you mentioned, you heard John say ripple delete.

[33:26] If you don't know what it means, ripple delete, it means delete anything that's

[33:31] from where the play head is to the end of the next clip.

[33:34] So if you've done chop, chop, chop already, and you want to remove a bit instead of

[33:39] doing a slice and then clicking on the elements and deleting it, and then dragging

[33:43] everything back to remove the gap you created, you can in one key, uh, say delete

[33:50] forwards or delete backwards.

[33:52] And in resolve, uh, I have my left hand on the Q and W, which is the first two

[33:56] letters next to the tab.

[33:57] And I've mapped Q to delete backwards and W to delete forwards.

[34:02] So I, I move the play head wherever I want and I hit Q and it removes what's before

[34:08] or W and I'm, I can be super, super fast with that.

[34:10] And that MX master has that little thumb wheel, horizontal thumb.

[34:15] So to scroll horizontally, I just spin my thumb.

[34:18] So I go spin, spin, spin, Q, spin, spin, Q, spin, spin, W, Q, Q, Q.

[34:23] And I can really quickly do that process.

[34:24] So if you're going to do that, I guarantee you'll save time trying to create some

[34:29] keyboard shortcuts that fit your brain and then stick to it.

[34:33] Uh, cause it's life saving.

[34:35] Yeah, absolutely.

[34:37] But now you don't even need to cause the robots will develop RSI for you, which is

[34:40] fantastic.

[34:41] Yes.

[34:41] So, um, let me continue my story.

[34:45] Uh, Recut.

[34:46] So I actually, I'm going to, uh, I was right.

[34:50] I checked the, I was right about the name.

[34:52] I'll post the Twitter account in the comments.

[34:55] Dave Sedilla is the name of the person creating this.

[34:58] I highly recommend you to check out from his profile.

[35:01] You'll find the getrecut.com.

[35:03] Uh, this is awesome.

[35:05] I would love to have Dave on the podcast, actually.

[35:08] Uh, instantly.

[35:10] Um, the reason I haven't bought it yet is because for me, removing the silences

[35:15] solves about 30% of the problem.

[35:17] The other problem is I, in the video, especially a 10 minutes long edit, which

[35:23] is like 30, 40 minutes of raw recording.

[35:26] I, in many, many, many places will say the same sentence three or four times.

[35:32] Or I said, I'll go like, let's add a text on the line and I type it wrong.

[35:38] So I deleted it and I said, let's take that underline and I say it wrong.

[35:42] So I start again and I do it three or four times.

[35:44] So Recut will remove the silences between, but it'll keep the four underline.

[35:49] And so the next, uh, the next, uh, step of the progression is something, some

[35:55] tool that can detect the waveform and say, dude, it is so close.

[36:00] I can guarantee that you were saying the same thing and you just messed up.

[36:03] So I'm going to keep the last one of these that look the same.

[36:05] I imagine that's how it works.

[36:07] Like the, actually, I don't think it's how it works.

[36:10] I think it does a transcript and then reads the transcript.

[36:13] And then if the word is the same, it, uh, kind of cans it.

[36:16] So this goes to my next discovery.

[36:18] Uh, fast forward, imagine I've done 20 or 30 videos like this.

[36:22] And I spent probably a good 10 hours of editing just this chop, chop, chop, chop,

[36:28] chop, chop, rapid process, which is my first pass.

[36:30] I call it my first of three passes when I edit.

[36:32] And at this point, I'm like, man, this is so boring and

[36:37] time-consuming and repetitive.

[36:39] And usually when these words come to your head, AI, usually AI is supposed

[36:46] to help with that boring, repetitive, predictable, low, low IQ, high,

[36:51] repetitively predictability.

[36:54] And I thought I'd just go, cause I haven't really researched, uh, I'll go on YouTube

[36:58] and search for like, is there any, uh, video editors that kind of talk about

[37:03] AI tools that helps their workflow?

[37:05] And I found this video.

[37:07] It's a channel that I used to not really like because it's, it's a bit, not cheesy,

[37:12] but it's usually for like marketers or like trying a bit too over hype over the top.

[37:17] Uh, they have this really broad audience channel and they teach about good

[37:23] lights and good cameras.

[37:24] Uh, I forgot the name of the, but it's, I'm sure you've seen it.

[37:27] It's like a very, one of the most popular channels, but they had this

[37:31] video called, uh, five AI tools that will transform your editing video, editing

[37:36] process.

[37:36] And I was like, Oh, what the hell?

[37:37] Let's look at it.

[37:38] And the tools I've discovered in there were like, holy cow.

[37:42] This is exactly what could save my bacon or like save my, uh, save me some time.

[37:48] And one of the tools, uh, presented was called Gling.ai G L I N G Gling.ai.

[37:56] And what Gling does is basically the path that Recut does, which is remove the

[38:01] silences, but it uses AI instead of, uh, I imagine Recut uses waveform detection.

[38:07] I have no idea.

[38:08] And that's why that'd be cool to have Dave on.

[38:10] But Gling, uh, you upload a video and it's like AI doing its thing.

[38:16] And it's, it writes a transcript.

[38:18] You might've seen it in tools like Descript as well.

[38:21] It literally, you have the text version of what you said on the

[38:24] left and the video on the right.

[38:26] And then you can, uh, you can select any bit of text and hit delete, and

[38:31] it's going to cut the equivalent bit of the video that says that.

[38:35] So you basically have words editing of your video audio, which is, is pretty

[38:41] trippy, but it doesn't stop there.

[38:43] What it does is it already pre highlights all the things that you've said more

[38:47] than once, it doesn't cut it for you, but it's a, Hey, I imagine this is how

[38:52] you want to cut it, uh, almost like a, like a Git diff, like sometimes you

[38:57] have this suggestion, you should probably accept this.

[38:59] Uh, let me just verify with you.

[39:01] So basically it's pre it tries to do the best job possible at removing all the

[39:06] repeated sentences and the coughing, whatever sounds like it, it's amazing.

[39:14] Like I tried it and I thought, uh, the free, the free tier has one video that

[39:19] you have access to full feature and then you can keep doing it, but it has water

[39:23] marks and stuff.

[39:23] And I thought, uh, I discovered, I researched this after the most painful

[39:29] 16 minutes video edit that took me three hours.

[39:31] And that's when I was like, okay, that was one of 71 videos.

[39:35] I cannot continue doing this.

[39:37] This is like for longer videos.

[39:38] And so that's when I did that research.

[39:41] I found this and then I edited, edited a few more videos that were pretty short.

[39:45] I was like, I don't want to use my one chance at full feature.

[39:49] So I waited until I had another long one.

[39:51] And there was another long, like 10, 12 minutes, like looking, the raw

[39:56] footage was like 12 minutes long.

[39:57] And I was like, what the hell this one I'm uploading to Glink for free.

[40:00] And I didn't touch anything.

[40:03] And it's did the most mass, like it literally did exactly the job I would

[40:08] have done, and that would have taken an hour, 45 minutes, whatever to maybe 98%

[40:14] quality, but the magic doesn't stop here.

[40:17] The magic is you can export this to resolve or final cuts, or I think that's

[40:23] the main two because they support XML format.

[40:26] And, uh, so I, I exported this pre cut thing in DaVinci resolve with, uh, the

[40:34] full ability to undo stuff or change the clips or like add a little bit of, uh,

[40:40] padding on the right of a word because it cuts too hard.

[40:42] So I didn't just had a raw file that's taken the silences and stuff off.

[40:47] I had the literally pre chopped with like a thousand cuts.

[40:50] Exactly the thing I do manually.

[40:52] I had it done by AI in like 10, 15 seconds plus the time to import.

[40:58] And that's when I was like, holy crap.

[41:01] And I went to Glink and I went subscribe and I paid for the monthly subscription.

[41:07] There's a yearly subscription that's cheaper, but I was like, I'm going to

[41:10] use it right now for the next few days.

[41:12] It's already saved me enough like that.

[41:14] I can pay $19 or whatever.

[41:16] Yeah.

[41:17] And, uh, from then I basically, uh, sped up this first pass workflow, like

[41:23] completely, ridiculously, tremendously, uh, you still have to import and then

[41:29] export and then sync, and you have that weird thing where you can

[41:34] only upload one video on Glink.

[41:36] And I have my screen and camera, but I want the same chopping to happen to both.

[41:40] And I was like, oh, how do I do this?

[41:42] And then I found a way in Resolve to do this, but it's kind of hidden and weird.

[41:46] And I'm sure there's better ways, but Glink is also talking about the ability

[41:50] to upload multiple things and sync them.

[41:52] So to solve that problem.

[41:53] Yeah.

[41:54] This is like, I've gone down such a rabbit hole with this stuff.

[41:58] Like probably, I don't know, maybe like three months ago when it, basically

[42:03] when I switched to DaVinci Resolve, um, I, yeah, I started, uh, cause we, um,

[42:10] yeah, I have Descript as well.

[42:12] And so Descript, like you were saying, allows you to like edit a script and it

[42:16] has this really great built-in functionality where you can just say,

[42:18] remove gaps and like you were talking about, um, with, uh, the, the first one

[42:25] you were talking about, recut, yeah.

[42:27] Uh, like you were talking about with recut, where you can like set the

[42:29] parameters of like, how much of this, of silence either side do I want to keep?

[42:33] Um, so you can kind of like fine tune it, uh, delete all of the gaps, and then

[42:38] you can go through and manually, um, script edit, and it also has the

[42:42] functionality where you can export it out, um, and put it into, uh, into DaVinci

[42:47] Resolve or Final Cut or something else.

[42:49] Um, and so I thought that was fantastic and I loved using that, but it just like,

[42:55] it, there were like a couple of things that it didn't like sentences where, um,

[43:00] it just like, it, it missed a whole chunk.

[43:03] Like there was a whole chunk where I was talking, but it just showed

[43:06] it as silence in the, in the transcript.

[43:08] Yeah.

[43:08] Um, and also the like cutting either side, just like, wasn't very accurate when I

[43:14] made it like a small number, um, or even when I made it like a larger number, it,

[43:18] like I had to go and like manually trim every single one to be like kind of the,

[43:24] the distance that I wanted it to be of silence.

[43:26] Um, and so then DaVinci Resolve actually launched this as well.

[43:30] So you can do this in, in DaVinci Resolve studio.

[43:32] So the paid version, um, you can do a transcription edit.

[43:36] So it will like go through, uh, and analyze everything, give you the full

[43:39] transcript and does a similar thing where like you highlight over a section and you

[43:43] see the video on the right of what you're, uh, the section that you're, um, that

[43:49] you're editing.

[43:50] And so you can edit through the script and it edits through the video.

[43:53] Uh, and it also has this delete gaps thing, but that was way worse than, uh,

[43:58] than Descript because Descript obviously focuses on that one thing where this is

[44:02] just like maybe a person or a small team within black magic that make DaVinci

[44:07] Resolve, um, the work on, on this, uh, you know, this one feature.

[44:12] So, yeah, I just found that like, like I lost total confidence in, in those ones.

[44:19] Um, because it kept just adding so much to my, to my process because I would need

[44:24] to like manually still trim everything.

[44:26] But then at the end I was like, but did we miss any bits?

[44:30] Like, was the, like, is there a chunk?

[44:32] Like I'd have to watch through and like really focus on what I was saying to make

[44:35] sure that there wasn't just like a chunk of explanation missing.

[44:38] Um, and so then when Gling, uh, like really got me excited because you can exactly

[44:45] what you were talking about, you, you chuck a file in there and it doesn't just

[44:49] delete everything.

[44:50] It gives you this like really nice color coordinated overview of what it's going

[44:54] to do if you click the button.

[44:55] And so you can go through and like quickly eyeball or even just like quickly listen

[45:02] through all of the bits that it's going to delete, um, or any bits that you think

[45:05] there might be something in there that it's missed.

[45:07] Um, and then if you're happy, commit, but I hit the exact problem that you're

[45:13] talking about now where I needed to then sync up, um, the talking head bits and my

[45:20] camera bits to the screen recording.

[45:23] Um, and so I do my capture slightly differently to you in that, um, when I'm,

[45:27] when I do a talking head, I just record that part on the camera.

[45:32] And then when I go back to the, the screen, um, sharing bit, uh, I, I go back

[45:39] to that full screen.

[45:40] And so I only have these little like segments.

[45:43] You don't have the full timeline in the camera.

[45:45] That's right.

[45:45] Yeah.

[45:46] So these, the two files aren't, uh, aren't like running for the same duration, but

[45:51] they're just slightly out of time.

[45:53] So you can sync them up.

[45:54] Um, I'm thinking like a collection of camera files to one really big, like long

[46:01] master timeline bit.

[46:03] Um, and so again, DaVinci resolve has really good tools for syncing these.

[46:08] Um, but the part that's missing is exactly what you're talking about, where

[46:11] you have like multiple sources or what's called multicam footage.

[46:14] And you want to use a tool like Gling to automatically remove all of the

[46:20] silences, but of this big kind of synced master project or master timeline.

[46:26] Um, and so, yeah, I'm really excited for Gling to, to fix that, to introduce

[46:32] that, that feature.

[46:33] Um, or the other option is like, put it all into DaVinci resolve, sync everything

[46:38] up, export out an XML, uh, which has all of that information in it, import that

[46:44] into something like Gling, then do the Gling bits and then export it out as

[46:48] XML again, to put it back into DaVinci resolve.

[46:50] Um, so yes, that's, that's my pain that I've experienced with this stuff.

[46:56] Like it solved the problem so perfectly, but I feel like there's just this small

[47:00] bit that's missing for me.

[47:02] Well, uh, Gling has exports to DaVinci resolve, and then it has another exports

[47:08] to DaVinci resolve multicam for this exact purpose, but what I found and what I tried

[47:16] it, and I didn't really manage to set it up properly, but also I, I've explained

[47:20] to you how I do my multicam is I sync them and then go left, right.

[47:24] Multicam is, uh, is trying to use the same timeline, and then you can switch

[47:29] from camera A to camera B whenever you want.

[47:32] So, but I don't want this.

[47:33] I actually want to remain separate, but have be synchronized.

[47:38] So the multicam didn't really work with my workflow.

[47:41] That's ingrained in my brain.

[47:43] So I kind of abandoned this and I found another way.

[47:45] I, I forgot it's completely unintuitive.

[47:48] I found this on a forum and you can, you can deconnect to the timecode something.

[47:54] And if the two audio, if the two files have the same time codes baked in, which

[48:00] it does when you record like this metadata to the video file, you never see, but it's

[48:05] like lots of information, like the lens, whatever, like for like cameras of the

[48:09] same, and somehow you can, you can, you can duplicate that, uh, edited thing that

[48:16] Glink did, and then you drag it to a second row and then you disconnect the

[48:21] time code and you relink with the other footage, which has the same time code.

[48:26] And it's like, Oh, I see what you mean.

[48:28] I'm going to use the same cuts, but on this other raw footage and that kind of

[48:33] worked, but it's, it takes a bunch of clicks and it feels really weird.

[48:38] Um, so yes, it's not just like a magic tool, but what I was going to say is it

[48:44] did the best job of all the times I've used it.

[48:47] It did the best job on my trial, my one trial.

[48:50] It's nailed that one.

[48:51] And I completely got over, you know, this hype curve that when you get overexcited

[48:57] and then you're like, Oh, and then you get down and then it kind of balances out

[49:00] to the, so it sent me over that like hype cause I, Holy crap, this is, I can skip

[49:06] this whole step, which is like 80% of the editing time.

[49:08] And then when I used it on the next video, it did exactly what you said.

[49:12] It skipped beats or it cuts every time a little bit too early.

[49:16] So I had to manually nudge every clip, which I realized for small clips is

[49:22] actually more work than doing it just manually myself.

[49:26] And so I, that's when I went down the curve of like, Oh, maybe that's

[49:29] not the tool I thought it was.

[49:31] And then I came up to a self arbitrary conclusion that if the footage is

[49:37] seven, if the raw footage is seven minutes long or longer, I run it through

[49:42] Glink and it's the pre chopping kind of makes sense to save me time, even

[49:47] if I manually edit the rest.

[49:49] And if it's less than five minutes, I do it manually because it's, it's more

[49:52] work to do the visual words, chopping verification, and then export and

[49:58] synchronize and then still nudge things.

[50:00] And I was like, I've probably spent more time doing it.

[50:03] Uh, and I, I had lost the confidence that I didn't cut off like a key segment.

[50:07] And there's like the, when I watched the video, like you said, I try to

[50:11] make sure the story makes sense.

[50:12] And if you do 70 videos, there's inevitably a time where you start

[50:16] dozing off while you watch the footage.

[50:18] And I got a rewind because I'm not sure what I just watched.

[50:22] So I did not, uh, it did not transfer my process from like, yep.

[50:25] Now Glink does, uh, abstract this, but I feel like as AI gets

[50:29] better, it is going to get there.

[50:31] Uh, my other problem with it is for very, I use it for very long videos.

[50:36] And so inevitably the, the text version of your script is very long too.

[50:41] So I would start at the top and look at the first 20, 30 lines.

[50:45] Yep.

[50:45] Yep.

[50:45] Yep.

[50:46] And then I couldn't help myself by saying, oh, can I just trust this thing?

[50:50] It looks pretty good.

[50:51] And like, I was like, otherwise, instead of editing in resolve, I'm

[50:54] editing in the word document, which I don't necessarily prefer.

[50:57] I don't have my ripple delete stuff keyboard.

[51:00] Like, and now I'm back to clicking and dragging and selecting.

[51:02] And so I ended up just accepting, uh, what it did, knowing that it's not,

[51:09] uh, it's lossless, the, the, the footage is still all there.

[51:12] You just have to manually adjust it.

[51:14] So I, I ended up opting to do my, let it do its best job possible and

[51:20] then do the nudging in resolve, which is the fastest for me.

[51:23] So it's still, uh, I'm still going to use that tool.

[51:25] It's really good.

[51:26] But just be aware if you use it, that it's not the magical, it will know

[51:31] exactly what your video is trying to do.

[51:33] There's also a thing in screen coding screencasts where you say a word and

[51:38] then you finish the code or you want to leave the, you don't want to type

[51:42] the class name in Tailwind and instantly switch to the next clip because you

[51:45] want people to have time to see it and maybe pause and copy and whatever.

[51:50] And because it edits audio, it's got no idea what it looks like on a screen.

[51:53] And so for coding screencasts, you always have to add some one, two second delay.

[51:58] So I tried to add the padding, but then it adds more space in wording.

[52:01] Like there's no, there is no magic recipe for coding screencasts that AI can chop

[52:07] perfectly unless it analyzes the visual thing as well, which it doesn't yet.

[52:11] Yeah, for sure.

[52:13] But it definitely, definitely sped up some of my process and, uh, uh, eased

[52:19] some of the pains of the past number one.

[52:21] I know I talk a lot, but it's the most time consuming editing part of the

[52:25] process and also the longest to explain.

[52:28] Yeah.

[52:29] Yeah.

[52:30] I, yeah, that's the exact part that I just want a one click thing.

[52:36] And I think you're right.

[52:36] Like it is, it's so close to being that, like what the, the point that we've

[52:41] come from to the point we're at now with these tools is just like incredible.

[52:46] Like that, that just like takes out so much of that work and now it's just

[52:52] about like tuning that little bit.

[52:54] So making it like, you know, detect these things, uh, more accurately

[52:58] introducing things like, um, you know, timelines that have multiple videos

[53:03] and being able to auto sync those before you start the process, all of those

[53:07] are like small tweaks to a really, really good foundational thing, like

[53:12] fundamental thing that's solving, uh, a huge problem.

[53:16] I think like if you've ever created videos, especially like long videos or

[53:21] a series, if you've ever done a course, anyone who's done a course, you

[53:26] will understand this pain.

[53:27] Like you, it takes so much time editing, like definitely more time editing

[53:33] than any other part of the process.

[53:35] Like, you know, like actually filming the recorded takes or on the other

[53:41] side, when you're like, you know, doing promotion and stuff that the part

[53:45] that, that you spend the most like focused time is just editing these

[53:50] clips and just dragging a play head around and slicing and then slicing

[53:53] other clips and moving things around.

[53:55] It's so time consuming.

[53:57] And I feel like if you can like use a tool like this to, to take care of that

[54:01] really boring, repetitive part that doesn't take, like, it doesn't take

[54:07] skill, it doesn't take creativity.

[54:08] It doesn't take any of those things that you need to do as a content creator.

[54:12] It just does the robot task of just removing all of the silences or whatever.

[54:17] And then like something that I found was that because I was like, because I had

[54:24] simplified that process, I then had more like creative energy to put into the

[54:31] polish.

[54:31] And so I wasn't already like exhausted from going through this process of cutting

[54:38] each, each clip so accurately because I just like outsourced that I could spend a

[54:45] lot more time on, you know, nice overlays or illustrations or like animations and

[54:49] things just really like upping the quality level of it.

[54:52] Absolutely.

[54:54] This is the main reason why a lot of creators end up hiring editors because it

[55:00] takes so much time.

[55:01] I have a very specific way of editing.

[55:05] I'm pretty peculiar of how my video, the pace and the vibe, I think it's a lot of

[55:10] my identity is like how videos are edited versus just like editing videos.

[55:14] And so the idea of like having someone else edit, even for the, the Epic Web

[55:21] workshop that I did, the team, Joel Hook's team behind Epic Web and Pro Tailwind and

[55:29] Matt Pocock's Total TypeScript, they offer editing services.

[55:33] So you record the raw stuff and put it in Dropbox, which is the first step I did.

[55:37] And then they take care of that.

[55:39] But I was like, I want to do, I am self-inflicted, flicking myself thousands

[55:44] of hours of editing, because for me, like the, the products and the quality polish

[55:49] is some, it's not that I think they're not good editors, but they will, they will

[55:54] edit differently.

[55:55] They will literally just cut off the silences and have the raw thing where I

[55:58] want it.

[55:59] And it's just so personal, like you have designed this, like if you've written a

[56:02] script or whatever, the way that you've designed this example, like all of it is

[56:06] exactly how you want to present it.

[56:07] So you have like, even subconsciously, you've got an idea as to how this is going

[56:11] to look when it's edited.

[56:12] And that doesn't mean just like, yeah, literally cutting the clips together.

[56:17] There's this, this kind of flow of, you know, the way that you have a

[56:20] conversation, the way that you deliver things.

[56:23] And I'm putting a comment on the screen.

[56:25] Daniel mentioned that the video vibe is like something that made it really

[56:30] special.

[56:31] And I've got, I get this all the time.

[56:33] And to me, it's very important to, to maintain this, like in any course that I

[56:38] create, I'm like, I want this to be the, the feel that people like, there's a way

[56:42] you make people connect with you through humor and pace and timing and music and

[56:46] all that stuff.

[56:48] And so you nailed it when you said the first pass, which I've described is boring

[56:54] and repetitive, but it's what sets you up for the creative and outlet where you can

[56:59] actually, if you still have mental energy, do some really, something really cool.

[57:02] And that's why I always thought maybe I can outsource to someone to, to do the

[57:09] pre-cut, but again, I want to make sure I'm going to have to go through it again

[57:13] to like, it's, I don't think I could ever like get someone to do, just do the

[57:17] pre-chopping because they're still, maybe sometimes I said something twice, but

[57:21] intentionally because of some humor or whatever to drive the point home.

[57:25] So I feel like AI is perfect because it's cheaper than having an editor that just

[57:31] does like four hours of pre-cutting and gives it back to you.

[57:34] And there's like asynchronous stuff where you can do it like on the fly, but yeah.

[57:39] It doesn't solve completely your problem, but it makes it better.

[57:43] Um, if every video started there, that would be ideal because I'm going to go

[57:50] faster through it, but then I have two more passes in my editing process and we

[57:53] can compare with you if you're happy with that.

[57:55] Yeah, for sure.

[57:57] Yeah.

[57:57] Uh, yeah.

[57:58] Something like, uh, something that I, uh, have been, uh, skirting around is that I

[58:04] have actually got an editor now.

[58:06] So my, my wife has, has started, um, editing my videos and it's, it's kind of

[58:12] the, the perfect balance in, in what we're talking about because she wasn't an

[58:16] experienced video editor before that.

[58:19] Um, and so it's not like she has this idea of, of how, how these videos should be

[58:24] edited and applying her experience to this thing.

[58:27] Um, basically I was like, I, you know, I need someone that just repeats this

[58:32] process, like that, that goes through and understands my content, my delivery.

[58:36] And like, um, you know, is getting it to, to this point where all of the silences

[58:41] have been edited out, all of the, um, like repeated takes have been edited out.

[58:45] Um, and then if there's any like additional.

[58:48] Polishy stuff.

[58:50] Um, like I have the time and energy to, to, to work on that.

[58:54] And it's just been awesome.

[58:56] Also the fact that we live in the same household.

[58:58] So it's like, it's really easy to, yeah, to like hand over a project and like, you

[59:03] know, we can trade off like, oh, there's, uh, you know, like last launch week with

[59:08] Superbase, um, is just like an incredibly busy time where we're launching a new, uh,

[59:13] a new feature and a new video every single day.

[59:16] Um, and so being able to like, Hand over the footage to her and then being like,

[59:21] all right, cool.

[59:21] I'll, I'll put the kids to bed.

[59:23] You start the editing.

[59:24] Like one of us could kind of like trade off this process of, uh, of, of getting

[59:28] all of these videos done, which was just like, yeah, such an amazing, uh, amazing

[59:34] time saver was awesome.

[59:36] Yeah, there's a lot of tricky parts about this first step.

[59:39] Um, I remember feeling guilty for absolutely no reason because when it's

[59:43] such a deep focus, repetitive stuff that you typically, I would go through multiple

[59:48] hours without taking a break, without checking Twitter, without checking Slack

[59:53] or anything.

[59:53] And I remember sometimes, like when I was at Tailwind Labs, I would have like this

[59:58] 40 minute long footage and I would spend an entire day just chopping it up really

[60:03] nicely.

[60:03] And I was like, every now and then I'd be like, it's been four hours since I haven't

[60:08] checked discord.

[60:09] Maybe someone wanted to talk to me or, uh, didn't listen to the community or like, I

[60:14] was like, I felt super guilty.

[60:15] Like I'm not doing any work where I was actually in crazy deep focus for the

[60:20] primary role that I'm doing, which is producing videos.

[60:23] And there's that, there's that weird perception of like, you're not making

[60:28] real progress and therefore you're wasting time.

[60:30] Well, yeah.

[60:32] So yeah, anything that can simplify this is good.

[60:35] But once you've done that pre-cut, which is the first, like, that's when I get

[60:39] excited about video editing, because like John said, this, now the creative process

[60:43] happens and I'm going to give you the, I've tried different techniques and what

[60:49] works best for me is to go in this order.

[60:51] And this is why on step one, I have the video left and then the camera left and

[60:56] the screen on the right.

[60:56] My second pass is actually really quick.

[60:59] I, uh, typically the intro segment, I'm going to be full screen with the camera.

[61:04] So I, I put this on like, remember all my clips are at 66% with like a specific,

[61:09] uh, offset, but in Resolve you can quickly click on a clip and there's that reset

[61:14] everything to factory, which is full screen.

[61:17] And so I have my camera layer below the screen.

[61:22] So the screen is masking most of the camera, but I have my little thing on the

[61:26] left.

[61:27] And then if I want to put the screen on top, I just set the screen to full and it

[61:31] just goes over.

[61:32] And if I want to set the camera on top, I have to either delete the screen and put

[61:37] the camera full screen, or I can change the opacity of the screen if I change my

[61:41] mind.

[61:42] But basically what I do is I, I click, uh, I leave things side by side while I'm

[61:48] looking at the camera.

[61:49] And the first clip where I'm starting to look at my keyboard and we go in code, I

[61:53] highlight with my mouse that clip of the screen recording, and then I go really

[62:00] fast forward.

[62:00] So in most editing software and actually even YouTube and stuff, there's J, K, L

[62:06] keys, which is like the playhead speed.

[62:08] If you go L, it doubled the speed every time you press.

[62:10] So you can go two times, four times, eight times, 16 times, and you can slow it down

[62:14] with J and L, uh, K stops it.

[62:17] So I literally go L, L, L, L.

[62:19] So it's like eight times, it's really, really fast.

[62:22] And I deep focus on my face and I'm like the whole time looking at the screen

[62:26] screen, screen, screen, screen, screen.

[62:27] And then I look at the camera and I'll start talking.

[62:29] So I pause here.

[62:30] And because I had highlighted the first clip where I started talking without

[62:35] looking at the camera, I go shift click on the last one and I make all this clip

[62:39] full screen.

[62:40] So that means all that segments, uh, now have the screen recording full screen and

[62:45] I'm not showing my face at all.

[62:46] That's intentional.

[62:48] I think it takes the, I don't really love when the speaker is always on the corner

[62:51] because I ended up looking at them and like forgetting what I'm supposed to

[62:54] listen to.

[62:55] And so I go through the whole thing like this.

[62:58] And then I go to the next clip where I look away from the camera highlights really

[63:03] fast until the next segment.

[63:04] And so at the end of this step that takes anything between one and four or five

[63:09] minutes, it's usually really quick because I can just blitz through.

[63:13] Uh, this is where the video goes from like pretty boring to already like, wow,

[63:19] it's, it's taking shape.

[63:21] So at the end of this process, I have a mix of screen recording and then some

[63:25] intervention where I speak to the camera on the side and then go back to full

[63:29] screen.

[63:29] And then I just look, if there's one moment where I speak for a really long time on

[63:34] camera, I'm maybe the middle one I go full screen.

[63:37] So it adds a bit of dynamic energy.

[63:40] And when I've done that, I have like a kind of roughly chopped video.

[63:46] Sometimes some of the cuts are too quick or too short and I have to nudge it a

[63:49] bit, but I already have a really entertaining video that has like camera

[63:54] changes and I'm like, Oh, this thing is taking shape.

[63:56] So that's my second pass.

[63:58] Uh, and most people would ship second pass and have already pretty good video.

[64:04] Uh, do you do something similar?

[64:06] Like to, to do your multi-cam decisions art direction?

[64:10] So I think like, yeah, very similarly, um, like, uh, yeah, the process in how I

[64:16] record my camera, uh, kind of, uh, has that same effect.

[64:21] So, um, when I'm scrubbing through the footage, uh, I can very quickly see where

[64:28] I'm switching from a, a screen sharing thing to a, uh, to a talking head.

[64:33] Um, and so, yeah, a similar thing, uh, like the reason that I, that I do it that

[64:39] way, jumping between those two, like fully focused, there's two reasons.

[64:43] The first one is like, like you said, when you're just like looking down at a

[64:46] keyboard typing or like looking down at a screen, like do people really need to see

[64:51] you while you're doing that?

[64:52] Um, or do you need to be as like bigger focus, like, like either going down into

[64:57] the corner and being small or like, or not being there.

[65:01] Um, and so, uh, by, by removing me entirely, like, I feel like this was, um,

[65:06] when I was doing egghead videos, I started thinking about it this way that it's like,

[65:09] just remove anything that's distracting off the screen.

[65:12] So you're removing absolutely everything that is not necessary.

[65:16] Yeah, yeah, exactly.

[65:18] You're removing everything in the UI.

[65:20] You're making everything full screen.

[65:22] You just take away any distraction that you can.

[65:24] Um, and so I, I kind of adopted that attitude about what, about me being on, on,

[65:29] on the screen as well.

[65:30] And I constantly go back and forth with this because it's like, like it does make

[65:34] it more personable having someone there.

[65:37] Even if you're like looking down, like what you said before, you're, you always

[65:41] get distracted by looking at the person, even though they're not looking at the

[65:44] camera and they're just sitting there typing.

[65:46] That's still because like, you know, naturally you're drawn to human beings.

[65:50] You're drawn to like, you want to look at a person rather than looking at just some

[65:54] code on the screen.

[65:55] So I always go back and forth with this about whether I want to have, um, me

[66:00] always there just as like a, a smaller, um, thing in the corner or, you know, less

[66:05] priority in some way or whether I want to remove it entirely.

[66:08] Um, but just because of the process of how I record at the moment, um, it makes it

[66:13] easier to just remove it entirely.

[66:14] So that's the first reason that, that I, I tend to jump between those two.

[66:18] The second reason is that it makes editing bits where I messed something up so easy

[66:25] and not just in the same recording session, but I often, especially with the, like

[66:29] really technical examples, sometimes I'm showing something, um, you know, with.

[66:33] Super base and database stuff.

[66:35] There's like, there's lots of moving parts between like next JS and all of this

[66:40] automated stuff that's going on on the backend.

[66:42] Um, and sometimes I'll be like delivering a, like, all right, cool.

[66:46] So then we click this button and then this thing happens and then the thing doesn't

[66:50] happen.

[66:50] And then I'm like, Oh no, I forgot to set something up.

[66:53] And I realized that there was just like one tiny little bit.

[66:56] Like I forgot to enable something in, in one of the parts because I have, because

[67:01] I'm now not on the screen during the time where I'm going through the example, makes

[67:06] it really easy to recreate the screen that I was on.

[67:10] So go to that menu where I forgot to click that button.

[67:13] And then I can really easily just record a segment to drop in there, um, where I

[67:18] click the thing.

[67:19] And then I'm able to then again, just go back to where I was and record the section

[67:24] where it was successful.

[67:25] And then it's seamless.

[67:26] Yeah.

[67:27] It's like a little curtain you close that the people can't see you and you do a magic

[67:33] trick and then you reappear.

[67:34] Yeah, exactly.

[67:35] Yeah.

[67:35] Cause if I'm on the screen, like I've got to also make sure I'm wearing the same

[67:38] thing.

[67:39] Like it might be two days later that I, that I'm doing an edit or whatever and

[67:42] realize there's some little bit that I need to need to add in there.

[67:45] Um, and so making sure I'm wearing the same stuff that I have my hair cut in the

[67:50] same way or shaved similarly.

[67:53] Uh, like it's, yeah, it's, uh, there's, there's too many variables that I need to

[67:57] match up if I'm also on the screen.

[67:59] Um, and sometimes like that stuff will happen.

[68:01] Like I'll go to put it out and then, Oh, we've changed the way this feature works.

[68:06] So we've changed the way that we set it up.

[68:07] Um, this happens, especially when like I'm covering some brand new thing that we're

[68:12] launching in super base.

[68:13] Um, you know, something might change about the UI or something might, um, like, Oh, we

[68:18] realized, you know, this may be a security vulnerability.

[68:21] So we need to change the way that you enable it like this.

[68:24] So then I need to add something to the video, but it's days and days later.

[68:28] And just before I'm going to go live with it.

[68:29] So rather than having to rerecord the whole video, we'll have this really awkward

[68:33] section where it like jumps between two bits where it's really obvious that like

[68:38] something changed there.

[68:39] I find it's really easy when I just have the screen showing for the bits where

[68:43] we're focusing on the screen and then me showing for the bits that focused on me.

[68:47] Um, it's really easy to find those edit points and seamlessly add in a section.

[68:52] Yeah.

[68:53] And by doing this, you keep yourself free of like, if you always, always have your

[68:59] face in the corner, you kind of like committed to this is, this is my vibe.

[69:03] There's always the camera.

[69:04] And so you can't like, if it disappears, people are like, Oh, did the, did the

[69:07] camera feed that like, it's almost your brand.

[69:10] So by mixing and matching, you allow yourself that.

[69:13] Um, sometimes I switch from side to side to full camera and back side to side, just

[69:18] because between one cut, I was finishing the word like this in the next sentence.

[69:22] I'm like, I moved my arms and it's impossible to do a nice cut.

[69:28] So I going full screen completely hides that thing.

[69:31] And same with the, the code.

[69:33] Like if you, if you scrolled a little bit and you didn't come back to the same

[69:37] point by just adding yourself on the side and then going away again, you completely

[69:43] people look at you and then they just get like the, that's magic.

[69:46] You like deviate the attention somewhere so you can do something else somewhere.

[69:50] Yeah.

[69:51] I do that a lot.

[69:52] Like sometimes I'll like, I'll realize that I've moved the mouse or like I've, I've

[69:57] opened another, um, file like off camera while I was editing stuff in VS code or

[70:02] whatever.

[70:03] Um, and then I go to edit it and I'm like, Oh, these two don't actually line up.

[70:08] There's this big jump where it's really obvious that the UI has changed.

[70:11] I'll just record a quick, like, so what we did, like, like just like a quick

[70:15] talking head where I'm like explaining, like just clarifying a little part about

[70:19] what we just did or whatever.

[70:20] And then, yeah, like you're saying, it's, it's like this slide of magic trick where

[70:24] it's like, look over here and now we're talking about this thing.

[70:26] And then when you switch back, it's like, you've, you've lost that perception of

[70:29] where was the mouse and what was on the screen.

[70:31] What did the UI look like?

[70:33] Because you've, yeah, you've, you've changed to this full screen, distracting

[70:37] magician.

[70:40] It also really helps with forget, forget what you just saw.

[70:43] Another, like, you know, real life thing that tends to happen is like, there'll be

[70:49] like, I'll need to go and pick up the kids from school at a particular time, or I

[70:54] need to finish up and go make dinner.

[70:56] And so I realized that like, you know, I might be only 60% of the way through the

[71:01] video.

[71:02] Um, and I've like, I'm not going to get through the rest of the video in the time

[71:06] that I have.

[71:06] Yeah.

[71:06] So then I might just, just record the talking heads, like the bits that need to

[71:10] look consistent where I need to look well-groomed and, you know, well-dressed in

[71:15] my super bass cap.

[71:16] Um, and then, uh, I can kind of like front load all of that stuff and just record all

[71:22] of the talking heads that I know that I'm going to need to do.

[71:25] And, uh, and then the next day when I come to recording, it's not as different an

[71:29] environment.

[71:30] Like I need to try and make sure that the mic level is, is the same, the energy levels

[71:35] are the same.

[71:36] Um, but there's not that visual aspect as well.

[71:39] Then I can just go through, um, yeah, like just recording the, the screen sharing

[71:44] bits without needing to make sure that everything else is like perfectly matched.

[71:49] Absolutely.

[71:50] That, that's why I mentioned in my like 71 video recording, I tried to record as many

[71:57] in one block.

[71:57] So there's a bit more consistency.

[72:00] I, that was a multi, that was a week long process.

[72:02] And, uh, I ended up, uh, like I had that question, like, what does it matter if I

[72:08] change from black to green t-shirt and stuff?

[72:10] Like, and I thought the rule is like, there's eight different segments in the

[72:14] workshop, which they have a break in between in real time when you develop.

[72:18] So I was like, I have to do within one segment, like I try to record everything in

[72:23] the same section.

[72:24] So it's, it feels consistent.

[72:26] And then if you, after the break, even if the person watches it two seconds later,

[72:30] I've changed it.

[72:30] It's like, Hey, it's a new day, new me, new something.

[72:33] And I ended up making sure I recorded till the end of a segment when I could.

[72:38] Um, I have one more note on the, the showing your face versus not.

[72:44] I do realize that sometimes it brings humanity.

[72:47] So when I go through my whole process, I actually, I don't only put the segment

[72:53] where I talk to the camera, uh, I look for anything interesting.

[72:57] And like, if I, if I make a little joke while I code and I smile and I have like

[73:01] a interesting little body movement, I'm like, Oh, I'll just bring that in.

[73:05] So it brings this, like, it, you can't help when you watch, you can't help.

[73:09] Like, Oh, holy crap.

[73:10] He's really doing everything on camera.

[73:12] Like it's got that the sound doesn't change.

[73:15] Meets like, I just remind people, Hey, I'm a human.

[73:18] It's not just like a AI voice talking through them.

[73:22] So I try to bring anything interesting that's spikes my interest.

[73:26] I add it on the, on the feed like this, but I think it removes the, everything

[73:32] that's not on camera is basically me looking in the same direction and typing.

[73:35] And there's nothing that should draw your attention away

[73:39] from the code in these parts.

[73:40] Yeah.

[73:41] That's something that is always missing that I'm always like, yeah, I wish I could

[73:44] just drop in for those like exciting moments where you like do something.

[73:47] And like you're saying, you react in a certain way or you laugh at

[73:50] your own joke or something.

[73:52] Um, yeah, I always have to, like, when that happens, I have to weigh up, like.

[73:56] Do I want to turn the camera on and record, like rerecord a staged

[74:01] version of that reaction, or do I want to just leave the audio version

[74:06] or do I want to cut it out entirely?

[74:07] So, yeah, that's definitely one of the benefits of always having that.

[74:10] By having all of it, you, you can like bring these moments.

[74:14] Cause like you hear, when I talk to you, like every now and then I go, woohoo.

[74:18] I'll make little sounds like, and sometimes like, oh, bringing the camera

[74:23] just for these little bits, uh, adds like a lot of dynamic energy, but otherwise,

[74:28] uh, and the last thing on camera, I think it has value when you live stream to

[74:32] have the camera always on because someone joins randomly and they see, oh, there's

[74:36] this guy live coding instead of just, but for, for edited videos, I think having it

[74:41] all the time is probably more harm than benefits.

[74:45] So that's my second pass.

[74:47] Once I've done this, I can watch the video and it's like, it's like good.

[74:52] Like I would ship that and not feel like, yeah, maybe there's a word that cuts just

[74:56] to be too short, or maybe the code is not shown long enough, but my third pass is

[75:02] essentially what I call the Simon Swiss Polish layer.

[75:05] Like that's when I take a good video to a great video.

[75:08] And, uh, what I do is I don't go because videos are long.

[75:13] I don't go at normal speeds, but I've trained myself.

[75:15] I listened to all my podcasts at two X speeds.

[75:18] I watched some videos at two X.

[75:20] So I press LL.

[75:22] So it goes one, two.

[75:24] And so it's everything at double speed, but you still hear every word.

[75:27] And, and so I watched the video and entirely at a two X speed.

[75:33] And I really focus on the delivery and how naturally it feels if I

[75:37] discovered it for the first time.

[75:38] And every time it feels a bit rough, I pause it.

[75:41] And then I just go tweak that cut.

[75:43] And then I continue doing the process.

[75:46] And I usually do that full screen as when I go come in F.

[75:48] So it's full screen and I watch it at two X.

[75:50] And every time it feels a bit abrupt, I go add a bit of tuning.

[75:54] A pro tip, you can use the comma and period keys to nudge left or right.

[75:58] If you select a clip to add like a frame frame by frame, instead of trying to

[76:02] drag while squinting to draw three frame, you go dot, dot, dot pushes by three.

[76:08] Another quick hint on the, you said you did command F to full screen it while

[76:12] you're watching another thing that I discovered recently is you can have

[76:16] what's called a clean video feed.

[76:17] So if you have multiple monitors, you can put basically a clean full screen

[76:22] version of, of what you're editing on one of those screens.

[76:27] And so when I'm editing on one of my screens, I have it full screen on the

[76:30] other. So if I, if I do a similar thing where I like watch through at two times

[76:35] speed to see if, if anything feels unnatural.

[76:38] And while I'm doing that, I can be looking at the left screen, full screen.

[76:42] And then as soon as I noticed one of those things, rather than the exit out, I

[76:46] just move over to the other screen and like quickly make a cut and then rewatch

[76:49] it on the other one. It's just like a fast way of having that, that clean video

[76:54] version going the whole time.

[76:55] That's a great point.

[76:56] I, so I have my laptop, which is 1350.

[77:01] I don't know. It's like too small to edit DaVinci Resolve because Resolve has a

[77:04] lot of UI bits. And then I have a 32 inch really big monitor.

[77:09] It's not 4K, but it's, I went for size instead of resolution because I want to

[77:14] have the biggest space for the editing.

[77:17] And so I go command F full screen and then escape pops you out of it.

[77:21] And I, I find it's almost faster because my hand is already resting on these

[77:25] keys. It's almost faster to hit escape than turn my head to the other monitor.

[77:30] And so I just, I do it in one, but I liked the idea of that.

[77:35] You can see both and then do the edits.

[77:37] So when I finished that, uh, when I finished that, most of the time it's like

[77:43] the third, I've done the layer of polish.

[77:45] And at this point it's a freaking solid video and I can export.

[77:49] And for the 71 I did that, that's where I stopped.

[77:52] Uh, sometimes I had the fourth layer, which is just the music.

[77:56] So I go on, I have a subscription for Envato elements.

[78:00] Envato is like this big marketplace.

[78:02] They're based in Melbourne, like the headquarters, Australian company.

[78:06] And they have like templates, WordPress teams and photos, stock photo.

[78:10] And one of them is like the music it's called audio jungle.

[78:14] But then they have Envato elements, which is like a subscription model where

[78:19] instead of buying individual stock assets, you have access to freaking millions of

[78:25] stuff. They have resolved transitions.

[78:27] There's lots of interesting stuff beyond just, uh, uh, audio.

[78:30] But for me, just the audio by itself, as it's like 90% of what I use is the

[78:35] audio, the libraries, like the quality of acceptance.

[78:39] If you want to upload stuff, there is very, very high.

[78:42] So the, everything feels very professional.

[78:44] Uh, and so I literally, that's my vibe, but I look for like a low fee jazz, hip

[78:50] hop, boom, bap sort of vibe.

[78:51] And I type this, uh, this search terms in the, in the music genre.

[78:57] And then instead of sorting by popular, cause I, I hate someone say, oh yeah,

[79:02] that's that song you hear on every video.

[79:04] So I sold by new always.

[79:05] So the results are a bit less relevant, but they always like brand new stuff.

[79:09] And I listen to anything from one to maybe sometimes close to a hundred, like

[79:15] first five seconds of the video.

[79:18] And what I do at this point is I have in mind how my intro is, if my

[79:22] intro is like 15 seconds long.

[79:24] Usually I say today, we're going to this, blah, blah, and then you do it as well.

[79:28] I say, all right, let's jump right into it.

[79:30] Or let, let's go, let's start.

[79:31] Let's get, I know you even have a soundboard stuff in your

[79:34] discord with that stuff.

[79:35] Yeah.

[79:36] I've got my, I've got two catchphrases.

[79:38] I've got the section where I go, I say, let's get into it is the catchphrase

[79:43] going from like the, the intro into like the, the code full screen thing.

[79:48] Um, and then at the end of the video, I say, keep, keep building cool stuff is

[79:53] the other when I, just a quick side note when I went to, um, we had like a super

[79:59] base, uh, like we all got together in Thailand recently and, um, yeah, just

[80:05] like the, the whole team just kept, uh, reminding me of my catchphrases.

[80:10] The, uh, at the end of each day, like if we're doing like presentation, cool stuff.

[80:15] Yeah, at the start of each day, the, uh, the, the CTO got me to, to say, let's

[80:20] get into it just before the first presentation started and then, uh, I

[80:25] would say, yeah, keep building cool stuff.

[80:27] And so, yeah, there was lots of, lots of jokes about my, my two catchphrases.

[80:33] It's great.

[80:33] It's, it's one of these little trick to get people to like, like it

[80:37] makes it familiar and friendly.

[80:39] And then you're like, Oh, I know this person.

[80:41] I knew they were going to say this.

[80:42] It just builds that connection.

[80:44] But yeah, so I started hack for me.

[80:46] Cause I, like, I have a script already, uh, prepared in Notion.

[80:50] So like I click a button and it, it starts a script for me.

[80:53] Um, and the first bit is like, I'm going to show you how to X.

[80:57] And so like, I've already got that like leading sentence where it's like, Oh,

[81:01] okay, well I just need to describe what the thing is.

[81:03] And so I just start typing.

[81:04] I don't need to think like, how am I going to start this?

[81:07] How am I going to make it fun?

[81:10] Those recurring things just kind of like allows me to just hit

[81:14] the ground running and start.

[81:16] Yeah.

[81:16] It's like a framework boilerplate.

[81:18] Like you have your starter template.

[81:19] And I had the exact same at, at Tailwind Labs.

[81:22] I never knew how to finish a video.

[81:24] I was like, all right, that's it.

[81:26] Uh, thanks for joining.

[81:27] And then I was like, I went, I always say, I'll see you in the next one.

[81:31] And I'll put my hand on the camera and it goes blur.

[81:33] And then I just fade out.

[81:35] And I was like, this is the perfect way to end because it's, it's not

[81:39] awkward and it's like, kind of like a signature at this point.

[81:42] I'll assume you can still hear me.

[81:44] You're frozen, but yeah, I've frozen.

[81:46] And so I went from like awkward.

[81:49] I don't know how to like leaving a zoom call.

[81:51] You're like, do I wave?

[81:52] Do I just hit eject to like this kind of punchy energetic outro?

[81:58] And yeah, so that, that's the same sort of trick, but for the intro, I look

[82:02] how long my intro is because I've done the pass already and then in the, in

[82:08] the, when you choose for an audio file, you can see, like we were talking

[82:12] about the waveform, you can see the song that have an intro because it

[82:15] starts small and it builds up.

[82:17] And then there's the drop, you know, like let the beat drop.

[82:20] And then I'm like, oh, this is about 10 seconds.

[82:22] And I have a eight to 10 second intro.

[82:25] So my intuition tells me that it's going to be a banger drop where I go like in

[82:29] this video, we're going to talk about this and how it improved this let's do it.

[82:33] And then bang, I can slap the camera and the beat drops and the transition

[82:38] comes and that intro with the punchy music and a fancy little transition is

[82:44] like 90% of like, uh, people going, oh my God, Simon's videos are incredible

[82:49] because I start and there's high energy and there's music that comes right on beat.

[82:53] It's not just like background music.

[82:55] It's like sort of calculated.

[82:57] So it flows with my intro and then boom.

[82:59] And, uh, that's the, I don't do this for my 71 videos in Epic web because it's a

[83:05] workshop and people are like learning on the sequence stuff, so I'm not trying to

[83:09] hype them up to a new feature with every video, but for, if you look at any video

[83:14] I do for Tailwind Labs or for my own stuff where it's a longer content, I typically

[83:19] do this fourth pass where I choose a song and I line up the intro with it.

[83:25] If I have time and energy, I do the little chapters where the music comes

[83:29] back and there's multiple segments.

[83:31] I've done one this week, actually a couple of days ago where I go through,

[83:35] there's a, there's a entrepreneur called Mark Louvion and he, he wrote a, a blog

[83:40] post with seven tips to make punchy headlines, like style tips.

[83:43] And I was like, this is really cool.

[83:45] And this would make cool content.

[83:47] So I did, uh, Hey, let's go through this blog post and

[83:49] build the seven tips with Tailwind.

[83:51] And so I have little chapter for each.

[83:53] It takes three, four minutes to prepare the transition.

[83:56] And then I just drag and drop and change the text every time.

[83:59] So I have the text and the background color and the music and

[84:02] they're all linked together.

[84:03] And then I drag the three segments for each chapter.

[84:05] And I usually bring back the same music at the end for the outro.

[84:09] And I try to find a beat that kind of lines up with the, my outro.

[84:14] Once again, usually the end of the song, or if, if it doesn't work, I

[84:17] kind of fade out in the way it's, I spend a bit of time making it sure

[84:21] that it sounds good because the last thing you want is the, the last segment

[84:25] of video music stuff, kind of like leave a bad note to something that's super polished.

[84:29] So if you're lucky, I do the fourth path for you and for my workshop, I'll do

[84:35] this for the intro, intro video and the outro, outro, and then the others only

[84:40] have the three passes, which is like chop, chop, chop, and then select, uh, art

[84:44] direct when I'm on camera, when I'm off.

[84:46] And then the third one is the final review and tweaking of the

[84:50] transition, so it feels really polished.

[84:52] That's my process in a nutshell.

[84:55] I love your musically timed intros.

[84:59] Like, like you're saying, it just like, it sets that energy level so

[85:02] high and it's just, yeah, awesome.

[85:04] Uh, it's definitely something that like stood out immediately way before we knew

[85:09] each other, um, when I was watching the Tailwind content, it's just, yeah.

[85:13] Amazing work.

[85:14] Yeah.

[85:14] And I did not know at the time, but there's that whole science that YouTube

[85:19] is all about retention for the first five, 10 seconds, and it's like, you

[85:22] got to really like grab them and show that you're about to deliver cool stuff.

[85:26] And I was like, Oh, I did not mean it, but I kind of approached it that way

[85:32] that I just want to start on the, on the strong point and I kind of did this.

[85:36] And I do think that it kind of helped with the people watching and then being,

[85:41] Oh, Tailwind is actually really cool.

[85:42] I should try it like the adoption of the framework.

[85:44] Yeah.

[85:45] There's this really like critical first 30 seconds of a video, um, which, uh,

[85:52] kind of determines how, how well it's going to do on YouTube.

[85:56] Um, and so yeah, trying to grab people's attention and show them that like the

[86:01] thing that you're covering is really cool and they should stick around.

[86:03] Um, most people, um, like the watching habits, uh, like, um, in the first 30

[86:09] seconds, I'll decide whether they're going to watch it or not.

[86:11] And so if you look at like retention graphs in, in YouTube analytics, so you

[86:16] can see like, where did people drop off?

[86:18] There's usually this like steep ramp right at the start going down like the

[86:22] reverse hockey stick.

[86:23] Um, which is like, uh, yeah, people deciding like they've, they, they saw the

[86:29] title and thumbnail that was enough intrigued them enough to click on it.

[86:32] And they started watching and then they were like, yeah, I don't, I don't care

[86:35] about this topic.

[86:36] Um, and so yeah, there's like a huge number of people drop off in the first 30

[86:40] seconds, but then you see that the graph really like levels out usually.

[86:44] Um, and because once people have invested past that 30 seconds and they've decided

[86:48] to stick around, usually they're going to stick around for most of the video.

[86:52] Um, and then you usually see another steep drop off right at the end of like,

[86:56] when you start wrapping up a video, people are like, Oh yeah, this is done.

[86:59] I'm out of here.

[87:00] Um, and so, yeah, there's this really.

[87:02] Critical 30 seconds at the start of a video that you want to be as engaging as

[87:06] possible and really like set up what they're going to learn, like what you're

[87:11] actually covering in the video and maybe like build a little intrigue about

[87:14] something special that they might learn, uh, if they stick around to the end of

[87:18] the video, uh, yeah, all these, all these little tricks, um, but yeah, like that,

[87:25] that musical thing, having musically like timed actions to music, um, and doing

[87:30] things like cutting to like, uh, um, an intro splash screen on like a big part of

[87:36] the, uh, of the music is a really effective way of doing that.

[87:40] Cause people like, damn, this is high quality stuff.

[87:42] Like, I wonder if the rest of the video is going to be up to this level.

[87:45] Um, and it's not the excitement probably like drops down a little bit as the, as

[87:53] the video goes, but that like that 30 seconds is that really important, important

[87:58] part to get someone invested in watching it.

[88:00] And once they're there, like they're actually learning the thing and they stick

[88:03] around for longer to, to learn the thing that they're interested about.

[88:06] Um, and so I'm, I'm very intentional in the way that I do super base intros or

[88:11] intros to my videos.

[88:12] Um, in the, like the first 30 seconds or usually the first minute, there's a lot

[88:18] more switching back and forth between the like full screen code and the talking

[88:24] heads.

[88:24] Cause like my background is very colorful.

[88:27] It's all very bright.

[88:28] And my screen is all in dark mode and very like, you know, different shades of,

[88:33] of dark grays.

[88:34] Um, and so I'm always really, uh, worried that switching to the full screen

[88:41] code example really early in the video, um, people are just going to see gray and

[88:46] boring and the energy drops off a little bit, the color drops off.

[88:49] Um, and then they're like, yeah, no, I don't, I don't want to watch this for

[88:53] another 10 minutes or whatever.

[88:55] Um, and so I really intentionally switch out to like talking heads to clarify

[89:01] things a lot early on in the video.

[89:03] And then again, that kind of like tapers off towards, uh, like as the video goes

[89:07] on, I get into more of like the technical complex stuff of the video.

[89:12] Um, yeah.

[89:14] And so that's another reason for that is to try and get people

[89:19] excited in the first 30 seconds.

[89:20] Um, and people have very primitive monkey brains that are like colors and

[89:27] excitement and happy faces.

[89:29] I want to keep watching.

[89:30] And so you want to engage that monkey brain as much as possible, but

[89:34] still give them the value.

[89:35] Like the difference is like both Simon and I actually create high quality, like

[89:40] content that is actually valuable to people.

[89:42] Like we're not just like, let's like do lots of really fast transitions to engage

[89:47] those monkey brains and then like sell them something or like give them, you

[89:52] know, bait and switch.

[89:53] Yeah, exactly.

[89:54] It's like, that's, that's the thing that, that makes me feel okay about, about

[90:00] using these techniques to try and get people engaged.

[90:03] I'm trying to get them engaged.

[90:05] So that they actually get something out of it.

[90:07] That's how you ideally would do it.

[90:09] You would deliver the value first and then, okay, now I need to convince them

[90:13] their value so they get to see it instead of spending all your energy in the hype.

[90:18] And then there's nothing to follow.

[90:19] Uh, if you, if you've never edited videos, you'll realize the exact

[90:24] same is true for building websites.

[90:26] I assume most people listening to this are building websites.

[90:28] There's the hero section above the fold.

[90:31] And there's so much science that if you nail these spots, uh, then people,

[90:37] oh, let me keep scrolling.

[90:39] I'm interested.

[90:39] And, uh, if the site doesn't go fast or the, the hero section doesn't really

[90:44] communicate quickly what you're doing, they'll bounce very, there's the drop-off

[90:48] rate within the first seconds is also really big to the point where there's

[90:52] tools like Hotjar that's kind of, uh, it's a script that observes where the

[90:56] mouse goes and what that, if they could track the eyes, they would, but people

[91:00] tend to track and the mouse goes where they're looking, so it gives you this

[91:03] hot heat map of like where, oh, the mouse went to the top, right, the subscribe

[91:08] button, then it went left to the headline.

[91:09] And then they're gone.

[91:11] So maybe we need to change the headline or something.

[91:13] And if you convince them, they scroll same with an email.

[91:16] If your first sentence is a 10 line paragraph that boring as hell, people

[91:21] are gone if it's super catchy and short and like you might win them over.

[91:26] And then you can tell them what you meant to tell them at the start.

[91:29] So it's just a whole capturing, capturing the interest of people.

[91:33] So they invest more time because they, they, you deserve that time

[91:37] because you get their attention.

[91:38] Yeah.

[91:39] Same with like blog posts and everything else.

[91:41] Like people is tracking all of that usage data.

[91:45] Like, uh, yeah, like if someone clicks on it and then how long do

[91:51] they actually spend on that page?

[91:53] Do they just look at the title and then click back and go somewhere else?

[91:55] Do they scroll down and actually start reading it?

[91:57] How far through that do they get?

[91:59] Um, all of that are usually very important signals to whatever those.

[92:03] Um, search engine things are the algorithms that serve up those

[92:08] different, uh, resources, um, how long people spend on that is a huge

[92:13] metric because the whole point of like Google search and the whole point

[92:17] of YouTube is to keep people on the platform and engaged as long as possible.

[92:21] And so if you can, if your videos, uh, keeping people engaged and they

[92:25] watch another video when they're finished and then another video, um,

[92:29] of your content, that's, that's a huge flag to, to YouTube that.

[92:32] This is keeping people on the platform.

[92:35] People are interested in it and we should push it to more people.

[92:37] To the absolute extreme of that, you have someone like Mr.

[92:40] Beast who literally spends all the money and energy and time analyzing

[92:46] what is the most perfect video in terms of like retention and looking

[92:51] at all the graphs and stuff.

[92:53] And that if you look at a Mr.

[92:55] Beast video, the first three seconds are like, you're going to win this boat,

[92:58] but maybe it's going to explode.

[92:59] And this is all shit happening for like seven seconds.

[93:02] And it's like, literally the video is about this.

[93:05] Like it's someone who's going to try to win this boat, but they're

[93:08] going to try to, he was going to win it, but then they're going to

[93:10] try to blast it with missiles.

[93:12] And like, and it's, it's all within three seconds.

[93:14] And then, and then, uh, uh, Mr.

[93:18] Beast goes like, he's like, if you hover on the YouTube thumbnail now,

[93:21] it's placed the first three, four seconds.

[93:23] So not only you need a good thumbnail, but then the, the start intro

[93:27] section should be aligned with that.

[93:29] Because if you have a, if you have a thumbnail about a, like a basketball

[93:33] court, and then the first video is a boat with missiles, you're like,

[93:35] what the, which one is it?

[93:36] So like, there's that whole crazy.

[93:39] And you said 30 seconds, but I think Mr.

[93:41] Beast is more like three seconds.

[93:42] Like it's, it's literally the drop off starts instantly.

[93:47] The more TikTok generation, like TikTok is like 0.8 seconds.

[93:51] I think if, uh, we were talking about the padding in wording, most of us,

[93:55] uh, like whatever boomers or Jen, I don't even know what generation we are.

[94:00] But when we make videos, there's a fade in and one second silence.

[94:04] And then, hello, let me talk about this.

[94:06] And if you look at the new generation, Gen Z, I think when, when the

[94:11] TikTok starts, the first word is half cut.

[94:13] It appears like today we're going to do, and it's like, because if you left, if

[94:17] you have a fading and one second pose, you got, I'm out, you haven't started.

[94:21] You've wasted one second of my next.

[94:24] So there's, it's funny how the retention gets shorter and shorter as people

[94:29] have remote control to change channels.

[94:31] There's more channels, they're more content, educational materials.

[94:35] And so, yeah, I think that it's very, but I never did it intentionally with my

[94:40] intros, but it happened to kind of make it work quite well.

[94:45] Daniel in the chat is referring to that as the boomer pause, which I have

[94:51] absolutely heard it like this.

[94:52] There's the, the, the exactly like, uh, there's that podcast called my first

[94:58] million, which is, it's so good.

[95:00] The name doesn't really reflect how good it is.

[95:02] It's just a business and great ideas podcast.

[95:04] And, uh, Sean, one of the hosts kept saying like, uh, I, I have to combat

[95:09] this obsession to leave a silence before I start because people just bail out and

[95:14] they will literally leave comments, like boomer pose, what Daniel said.

[95:18] He might've heard it on the podcast that like people says, stop wasting

[95:22] one second, just go straight into it.

[95:23] Uh, yeah, it's fun.

[95:26] Uh, and, but that's all the editing part that comes in the last pass.

[95:29] Once you, to do any of that, you need to first do the chopping

[95:32] and the art direction.

[95:34] And then, uh, initially I was trying to do everything at once.

[95:38] I was editing the videos.

[95:39] Oh, maybe I should be on camera here.

[95:40] And I was progressing really slow while chopping the bits.

[95:43] And then I realized if I do passes, it lets me like focus.

[95:48] What is the task right now?

[95:49] It's like the assembly line.

[95:50] You first do a coat of like drywall and then you mud and tape and then you send

[95:55] and then you paint instead of trying to do one wall at a time.

[95:58] Yeah.

[95:59] Yeah.

[95:59] I used to do the same thing of like trying to just edit.

[96:02] Like chronologically and just start like at the start and start doing like a fine

[96:07] edit right from the first frame.

[96:09] And it's, yeah, it just, it just doesn't work when you are editing such a huge

[96:14] amount of content.

[96:15] Um, yeah.

[96:16] And I think, yeah, that's a real benefit to that.

[96:21] Like, um, the way that I've been doing it, just manually chopping out the

[96:24] silences and being able to just kind of like, um, you know, disengage a little

[96:29] bit while I'm, while I'm doing that.

[96:30] It's not this like really focused process where I'm really like engaged in what

[96:34] I'm doing, um, that has allowed me to like keep the energy level really high

[96:40] for those other parts of the process.

[96:43] Like I'm not feeling as fatigued and exhausted, um, by trying to, to kind of

[96:48] get the fine edit done all at once.

[96:50] I can kind of do this like repetitive factory work at the start and then, um,

[96:55] have that really creative, um, bit that I can add the polish later.

[96:59] Is there anything else you want to cover, Simon?

[97:01] We've been doing this for a long time.

[97:02] We always go for so long.

[97:04] We have an hour of a conversation before we start.

[97:06] We have a half an hour of conversation while we're live and then we record the

[97:09] episode and go for another hour and a half.

[97:11] So yes.

[97:12] I'll be really quick because this is value here.

[97:14] Very value on the discussion.

[97:16] You stuck around to the end.

[97:17] Here's, here's the big, the big nugget, the reward that you get.

[97:20] Mistakes I've learned in the process of doing this, uh, choosing the music

[97:24] before editing the video, after recording, I would start the editing process.

[97:28] Oh, let's wait.

[97:29] I'm going to need music.

[97:30] So let's start with the music.

[97:31] What sort of vibe is this?

[97:32] Uh, I'm talking about this topic.

[97:34] So I should choose this music and I would like have no, uh, way to figure out the

[97:41] intro length and this stuff I talked about before.

[97:42] So I would just pick a music arbitrarily.

[97:44] And then when I edit the video, it was really hard.

[97:47] And so, oh, the music doesn't work.

[97:48] I need to find another one.

[97:49] So music and all Polish comes at the end, no matter what.

[97:53] Now, I, if I, even if I'm tempted, I have some sort of vibe in my, in my mood.

[97:57] I'm like, I forget that that comes later.

[98:01] That's the first thing I wanted to say.

[98:02] So leave the Polish for the end.

[98:03] Uh, the more assembly line and predictable you do it, the, the

[98:07] better compartmentalize you can do.

[98:10] And the better AI will be able to take over because it's predictable.

[98:13] Uh, and the other thing I wanted to say.

[98:15] Just quickly on that, before you move on to the second point, um, what that also

[98:19] gives you, um, I heard this, this described by, um, another video editor

[98:24] on YouTube that, um, basically if you do it in those like different versions of

[98:29] cards, if you're working as like a professional editor or working as a

[98:33] professional content creator or a professional educational video recorder,

[98:36] um, the, you always have something that you can release at all of those points.

[98:42] So if, if a deadline is, is approaching quickly, uh, you might realize like,

[98:48] okay, I can sacrifice a little bit of the Polish, or I can sacrifice a little bit

[98:51] of this, but if you're going through sequentially or chronologically editing

[98:55] and you're, you're, you're doing that fine Polish from the start to the end.

[98:59] If that deadline's approaching and you're only 60% of the way through,

[99:01] you've only got 60% of a video.

[99:03] So like you can't, you can't bail out at that point.

[99:06] You have to keep going for the last 40%.

[99:08] Whereas if you've done a rough cut and then you've gone through and

[99:11] you've done like a fine cut, then.

[99:13] And then you're going through and doing the Polish.

[99:15] You may have already polished the first 60% of the video, the first 40% of the

[99:20] video, and that might be that most important part where you have that first

[99:22] 30 seconds where you're trying to engage someone, but you have a releasable

[99:26] product at any of those points, basically after the, well, maybe after like the,

[99:30] the second version of, of going through all of that, you have something that

[99:35] you can release if you have to release it.

[99:37] And if you have the time, you can keep working on polishing it.

[99:40] So it's a really good.

[99:41] Um, like professional tip as well to, um, to go through it in that process.

[99:47] Make a clip, like a subset of the video.

[99:49] I saw Matt Pocock do that yesterday.

[99:51] He is doing a video on how to publish something on NPM.

[99:55] And he said, here's the first three minutes, uh, video coming soon.

[99:58] So I guess he's halfway through editing and he's like, Oh, that's a clip.

[100:01] So that's, that, that was going to be my other tip.

[100:03] Sometimes you edit and there's a little blooper or something funny or interesting.

[100:06] And I always, Oh, this is, there'll be such a little thing to clip.

[100:10] Um, resolve has, uh, the letters I and O starts the eyes, like the start of the.

[100:16] It's like a subset of the timeline play.

[100:20] You can, you just press I to start and then press O to finish.

[100:24] And then you can export just that bit.

[100:25] So I've started exporting straight away and tweeting it right away.

[100:28] Say, Hey, I'm working on this.

[100:30] Here's a cool segment.

[100:31] And you create that hype marketing excitement that you wanted to do.

[100:35] You do it straight up and people can, it gives you that little flow of adrenaline

[100:40] instead of like thinking, Oh, I should do this.

[100:42] And then you have to go back and scrub the video to find the moment.

[100:45] So even if you don't publish it, just have a, have a fun beats folder where

[100:50] you export little segments, little clips.

[100:52] I found like a really cool trick.

[100:54] Uh, I'm really pissed off that I forgot because Daniel said something, which is

[100:58] what I was thinking, what I was saying before, uh, in my head, I was like, when

[101:02] you buy a domain name before building an app, you're like, Oh yeah, this is choosing

[101:06] the music before is the same.

[101:07] You're like, this is going to be great.

[101:09] It's going to have this vibe.

[101:10] You choose the name.

[101:11] And then you're like, Oh, like, how do I build this to make it a business?

[101:15] Um, I disagree.

[101:17] That is the, the, the definitely the right way to do it is either domain name

[101:22] first, have a catchy name, and then you can work backwards and work out

[101:26] what you're actually going to build.

[101:27] I still have one more thing to say.

[101:29] It's very important.

[101:30] This has bled into how I build websites.

[101:34] I, with Tailwind specifically, uh, Tailwind is amazing at rapidly

[101:39] prototyping something that looks good enough.

[101:42] And you've seen that process through the NavBar website.

[101:44] I'm going to build a rough, which is the equivalent of the rough cut.

[101:48] There's the layout, three columns, not responsive, who cares, whatever.

[101:52] But it's like a first pass.

[101:53] And then I could ship this and say, Hey, it's a work in progress.

[101:57] Don't, don't shame, don't shame the code.

[102:00] It's not finished, but it's, it's viable already.

[102:02] Instead of just having the NavBar perfectly built.

[102:06] And then I go do a second pass where I tweak the padding and the colors and the

[102:10] font, and I go through multiple passes, almost like a JPEG rendering or P, I

[102:15] don't know which one, start with pixels and then it gets better.

[102:18] This is something that Adam and I clashed a lot on when I was at

[102:21] Tailwind Labs, because he would review some code and say, Hey, do that.

[102:25] The padding is completely wrong.

[102:26] And I was like, Oh yeah, I'm just doing a rough pass and then going through.

[102:28] And Adam is, uh, if you watch the streams he's done recently, he's,

[102:32] he's completely different on that.

[102:34] He's like every bit you start, you just completely pixel perfect finish.

[102:39] And then you move and then, you know, you know, kind of anything

[102:41] that's on the screen is done.

[102:42] Where we Tailwind UI components, I would, I would do a rough pass

[102:46] knowing the next pass I'll fine tune it.

[102:49] Both value, both have their value, but I work much better in like sequences,

[102:54] rough cut, and then polish, uh, iteration.

[102:57] So I find funny that my video editing and Tailwind programming

[103:01] process is the very same.

[103:03] There's, I do the rough cut, then I do a second pass.

[103:05] And then if you're lucky, I go through the Simon Swiss polish of the third

[103:08] thing where you add animations and, uh, and then you end up with

[103:11] like the really solid stuff.

[103:13] Yeah.

[103:14] That's a good point.

[103:15] Like, yeah, with building websites professionally, you can always have

[103:18] something that's ready to release.

[103:19] It's also like, uh, even, uh, even more applicable in the, in, in the web

[103:25] development space, because you can still be adding those layers of

[103:28] polish after it goes live.

[103:29] Like you can put it live because you need to hit that deadline.

[103:32] And then you can be like, Oh, here, here's a little thing that I could

[103:35] tweak or like, here's a little really convenient feature that I could add on top.

[103:39] Um, it would be nice if you could do that with videos.

[103:42] It would be nice if YouTube allowed you to keep, uh, tweaking video.

[103:46] Git for video, where you can do a pull request to fix the thing you said wrong.

[103:50] Yeah.

[103:51] That's the other thing.

[103:52] Video editing is so set in stone, hard-coded that you, you end up

[103:59] sometimes re-recording the whole video when, when the framework updates

[104:03] something, you can't just, Oh, let me PR the, uh, update the

[104:06] dependency and change the code.

[104:08] Yeah.

[104:09] Like even rendering the video is a destructive process.

[104:12] Like it's removing a bunch of quality and like breaking in, like, yeah, you're

[104:16] really like, yeah, setting the concrete on your video.

[104:19] And if you want to change something about the video, like you've essentially

[104:23] got to create a different version of that video and YouTube works the same

[104:26] way once you upload something that's immutable, you can't like one video is

[104:30] linked to one YouTube video ID.

[104:33] That's one URL.

[104:35] And so if you want to change something about that video, you need to upload

[104:38] another version of the video and try and direct the audience from one to the

[104:43] other, which is what I have been doing a lot of late recently, and it's not fun.

[104:47] Yeah.

[104:48] Even YouTube, you can't, yeah, delete.

[104:50] You lose all the comments and the views and stuff.

[104:52] Yeah.

[104:53] The closest to version control and code driven video, I've seen

[104:56] Delba from the Vercel team.

[104:58] She's using it, this app.

[105:01] It's an open source thing, which is basically React, uh, to generate, uh,

[105:06] videos like it, you create, I don't know exactly how it works, but you can

[105:11] create transitions and kind of like, uh, like, uh, you can do slides, you know,

[105:15] there's like this, there's like this slideshow tools or React music that can

[105:20] reload it to, to use the web audio API to create a, like a sequencer and then the

[105:24] drone, uh, but there's one to make videos where you, you have text and you can

[105:29] style it and you can say how it, how long it says on screen and, and Delba makes

[105:34] these videos that it feels like it's done with after effects and motion graphics,

[105:38] but it's all driven by code.

[105:39] So imagine if you make a mistake, you're like, oh, just do a PR and change

[105:44] the, change the animation or the code sample here, and you can go and revise

[105:49] the stuff.

[105:49] So it feels like getting closer to, uh, revisable video making, but I love the

[105:55] process of like having raw footage and just, it's like a, an art, you get clay

[106:00] and you just build something with it.

[106:01] And you never think about code anymore.

[106:03] It's more like the art directing the storytelling.

[106:06] And I, I don't think I want to do it in code just for that reason.

[106:09] Hmm.

[106:09] All right, Simon, you're done talking about editing.

[106:13] We're out of here.

[106:14] But before we go, uh, do you have a sick pick for me this week or do you need me

[106:19] to jump in while you're thinking?

[106:21] I have a, I have a sick pick.

[106:23] Uh, I just, I looked up and I thought of it yesterday.

[106:27] Literally last, it's Wednesday today.

[106:29] Yesterday I installed just above my head, a ceiling fan with a led light and it's DC

[106:35] powered.

[106:36] I can't show it to you, but I can show you the remote that goes with it.

[106:39] Uh, it has a light.

[106:41] I don't think I'll use it much, but it's a three color, like pure white and then

[106:46] mid yellow and very yellow.

[106:48] And you can change the intensity.

[106:50] So I might actually be able to use it as a, almost like feel ambient background

[106:54] lights.

[106:55] It's above me, but it's like very broad, it's not like just on my head.

[107:02] And then it has a DC engine and there's AC and DC and basically DC is much more

[107:08] silent.

[107:08] It's a bit more expensive, but it's silent and I don't have it on now because

[107:12] it's winter, but I can have it on level two out of six and it's, it doesn't get

[107:16] picked up by the mic even being above my head.

[107:18] So it's going to be such a nice addition if I can record and stream with a ceiling

[107:23] fan cause all the heat gets trapped there.

[107:24] Uh, yeah.

[107:26] So shout out to, um, actually not that it's going to drive business to him, but

[107:30] there's a guy called Myles Thunder Electrical Coffs Harbor.

[107:34] He's the most awesome.

[107:36] I had lots of tradies and electricians come.

[107:38] This guy is above and beyond the best, the coolest.

[107:41] I had my idea.

[107:42] I was like, I want it here.

[107:43] He was like, no dude, you want it here because X reason.

[107:46] And then the, the airflow and also aesthetics and stuff.

[107:49] And he had so much to say about like delivering a polished, uh, experience and

[107:56] final product.

[107:57] And that was awesome.

[107:57] Nice.

[107:59] So once again, you've gone, you've gone from a single pick to a double pick.

[108:04] What have I done?

[108:07] Uh, you've gone for, you started with a single pick that was the fan and now

[108:12] you've gone with a double pick for all of the people in Coffs Harbor who want, uh,

[108:15] a great electric, uh, thunder electrics.

[108:18] Uh, I left a Google review, uh, praising him cause really was awesome.

[108:21] And I'd like, if I need anything, electricity related, a hundred percent

[108:27] calling him and he, yeah, we had a nice chat is such a cool dude.

[108:30] Like really.

[108:31] It's so nice when you get to have one-to-one business transaction that

[108:37] turns into like way more than just the transaction.

[108:39] Yeah.

[108:41] And my camera has run out.

[108:43] Sick pick, sick picking the dark.

[108:45] And we've lost, uh, if you're watching, uh, John is just a black square now

[108:50] because the camera decided that it needs a Ryobi battery.

[108:53] Oh, he's back with the terrible low quality.

[108:57] Uh, webcam version for the, for the end of the video.

[109:00] Yeah.

[109:01] Should I switch to my webcam to lower myself too?

[109:04] Uh, so my final, uh, look at me, look at me.

[109:14] I'm in my webcam too.

[109:15] Oh, there we go.

[109:18] Yeah.

[109:18] We've both got both got terrible quality recordings.

[109:21] That's fantastic.

[109:22] Uh, I'm just trying to record this last bit so that we can use it for, uh, if we do.

[109:28] Sorry, you cut all the rest because it was boring and now

[109:32] you start the podcast again.

[109:34] Yep.

[109:34] All right.

[109:35] So welcome to the NavBar.

[109:36] Uh, today we're going to talk about video editing.

[109:38] Uh, my sick pick for this week is, uh, a game called Baldur's Gate 3.

[109:46] So, uh, I don't know.

[109:48] Are you into any games, Simon?

[109:51] I'm into sports games a lot and not video games really.

[109:55] This is, it's a time constraint thing more than anything.

[109:58] Yeah.

[109:59] Yeah.

[109:59] And I, I always have this, this issue with, uh, finding time to play

[110:05] games because of the same thing.

[110:06] It's a time constraint thing.

[110:08] Uh, you know, there's, there's a very small window of time in the evening,

[110:13] uh, where like me and my wife can just hang out without, without kids and

[110:17] stuff and do the things that we want to do.

[110:18] And so, and in that time we want to hang out with each other.

[110:21] Um, and so, uh, Baldur's Gate 3 is awesome because it's a couch co-op game.

[110:27] So that means that you can both sit there with a controller

[110:30] and play it on the same screen.

[110:31] Um, and basically it is, uh, it, it's a Dungeons and Dragons game.

[110:37] So if you've ever played D&D, like I played a bunch of D&D as like a high school team.

[110:43] Um, and so it's like a really complex role-playing game where you can basically

[110:48] do anything, um, and there have been lots of iterations of trying to turn it into

[110:52] like the video game version of that.

[110:54] And I feel like Baldur's Gate 3 is the first time that

[110:57] they've like really nailed that.

[110:59] So, uh, if you like very, very large, um, games that, uh, you can do anything

[111:08] and you have like just endless things that you can back out and yeah, and just

[111:14] like endless quests, you can do an endless things, and you also have a

[111:19] friend that you want to play with either in the same room or just online.

[111:23] Like you can play, um, cooperatively with like people on the internet.

[111:28] Uh, I would highly recommend Baldur's Gate 2.

[111:31] It's awesome.

[111:32] Nice.

[111:33] I like the co-op side of things.

[111:35] Uh, my wife is the furthest away from doing anything on a screen that you'll find.

[111:42] She's a camper, outdoors runner, athletes running, trail running, dog running.

[111:48] And she looks at her phone a whole lot.

[111:51] I got to say this, but it's like, it's always while doing something else.

[111:55] And she, we have a couch.

[111:57] I don't think I've seen her sit on the couch once.

[111:59] She can't sit still.

[112:02] So, uh, unless there's an outdoor, well, maybe we could do the actual

[112:07] real role-playing thing together.

[112:09] Cause the couch plus remote, it's going to be a hard sell for

[112:12] me.

[112:13] Yeah.

[112:13] You just need to get some swords and things and maybe some enemies out in

[112:17] the real world and you can go and play.

[112:19] Well, thank you so much for listening to another episode of The Nav Bar.

[112:25] It's been fantastic hanging out with you again, Simon.

[112:27] We have taken an episode that we thought would just be like a quick summary of our,

[112:34] our current, uh, recording, uh, setups and it's blown out to like an hour and a

[112:40] half again.

[112:40] So by now we should know that video editing is a consuming, time-consuming and

[112:46] also time-consuming to explain the intricacies of.

[112:50] Like we, we, you know, we're kind of like a tech podcast and we always like, um,

[112:55] you know, frame it around tech stuff, but really we probably spend more time

[113:00] tweaking our video editing stuff.

[113:04] And like we spend more times, more time on video production than we probably do

[113:07] actually writing code at this point.

[113:09] So this is our, I think that's the skill that's differentiates us or like way you

[113:14] get really, really good at this.

[113:15] I think you and I both can, uh, stand out with that skill of like making really

[113:20] compelling videos.

[113:21] So it's kind of nice to show the thinking that goes behind it.

[113:23] Absolutely.

[113:25] So thank you so much for listening.

[113:27] Thank you for joining us live to the people that are in the chat and we will see you

[113:30] again next week.

[113:31] Bye bye.

[113:32] See ya.

[113:33] Simon, you've got to say.

[113:38] (laughing)

[113:40] you
