## Chapters

### 00:00 - Introduction and Simon's Company Retreat Experience

Simon shares his recent experience at a company retreat for ThinkMill, highlighting the rejuvenating effects of in-person interactions with remote colleagues. He describes the retreat's structure, which included a day of informal internal conference-style presentations followed by outdoor activities in the Blue Mountains.

This chapter sets the tone for the episode, emphasizing the importance of face-to-face interactions in remote work environments. It showcases how intentional team-building activities can strengthen relationships and improve overall team dynamics, even in companies that primarily operate remotely.

### 07:51 - Challenges of Remote Work and Team Building

The hosts discuss the difficulties of maintaining team connections in remote work environments. They explore various strategies companies use to foster engagement, such as virtual team lunches and games, and the challenges these activities can present.

This section delves into the complexities of remote team building, highlighting both successful approaches and potential pitfalls. The conversation touches on the "mandatory fun" dilemma and how well-intentioned team-building efforts can sometimes feel like additional work rather than genuine connection opportunities.

### 25:17 - Intentional Scheduling and Work-Life Balance

John introduces his "sick pick" of scheduling evenings to maintain work-life balance. The hosts discuss the benefits of pre-committing to activities and being intentional about personal time, especially for those with busy family lives.

This chapter offers practical advice for listeners on managing their personal time effectively. It emphasizes the importance of variety in activities and the benefits of pre-planning to ensure quality time is spent on desired activities, rather than defaulting to passive habits like excessive screen time.

### 41:02 - Disconnecting from Technology

Simon shares his "sick pick" of camping off-grid as a way to disconnect from technology and reset. The hosts discuss the benefits of completely unplugging from work and technology periodically.

This section explores the value of intentionally disconnecting from technology and work-related stresses. It offers insights into how such experiences can lead to better sleep, improved family connections, and a refreshed perspective on work-life balance.

### 59:21 - Content Creation Strategies and Lifestyle Integration

The conversation shifts to discussing content creation strategies, comparing tech content to lifestyle content like fitness videos. They explore the challenges of creating evergreen tech content versus content that can be consumed repeatedly.

This chapter provides an interesting perspective on content creation in the tech industry versus other fields. It highlights the unique challenges tech content creators face in producing content that remains relevant and engaging over time, contrasting it with fields like fitness where content can be repeatedly consumed.

### 72:54 - Closing Thoughts on Tech and Work-Life Balance

The hosts wrap up the episode with reflections on the importance of maintaining a healthy work-life balance in the tech industry. They discuss the potential pitfalls of overworking and the value of using tech industry benefits to improve quality of life.

This final chapter serves as a call to action for listeners to prioritize their personal lives and well-being alongside their tech careers. It emphasizes the importance of using the benefits of tech jobs, such as higher salaries and flexible work arrangements, to enhance overall life satisfaction rather than simply working more.

## Transcript

[00:00] Oh, welcome to the NAVBAR, a podcast where usually, uh, John Myers makes the intro, but

[00:06] I've just taken over so he cannot jump in.

[00:09] My name is Simon Vrashly-Otis and you are?

[00:13] John Myers.

[00:14] Thank you.

[00:16] Welcome to the podcast.

[00:17] Thank you for doing the intro.

[00:18] Just before we went live, Simon had to remind me, okay, you've got to stop swearing now,

[00:23] uh, because I've hit the big red button.

[00:25] So I think that's why he quickly jumped in and took the intro was just to make sure we

[00:28] can still put this out through, uh, the non-explicit channels.

[00:32] Yes.

[00:33] Uh, always worth a double check, uh, Hey, heads up.

[00:37] We're going live.

[00:38] Stop being the, the behind the scenes version of John that people don't hear.

[00:42] Clean up that putty mouth.

[00:43] Let's go.

[00:44] Simon, how's your week been?

[00:48] It has been amazing.

[00:49] Uh, if you heard the episode last week, I did a specific, uh, sick peak about IRL in

[00:57] real life, uh, events, uh, as remote workers.

[01:01] And last week, right after the literally right after the episode, I packed my bag and left

[01:05] for Sydney for a two, three day, uh, gathering.

[01:09] It was literally called gathering the name of the events with a think mill, the company

[01:13] I work at.

[01:14] And oh boy, it was amazing.

[01:16] Um, I feel rejuvenated.

[01:19] I feel closer to my team.

[01:21] I feel smarter because I've learned a lot of things.

[01:23] I feel healthier because we've done lots of hiking in the blue mountains.

[01:27] Uh, yeah, it lived up to the expectation and that was super cool.

[01:34] That's awesome.

[01:35] Yeah.

[01:36] Yeah.

[01:37] Oh man.

[01:38] It's yeah.

[01:39] It's so nice actually meeting the people that you work with.

[01:40] Uh, I don't know how many people out there listening, uh, in the same situation as us,

[01:44] but we are working remotely and have been for a long time now.

[01:49] Definitely ever since, uh, COVID kicked off.

[01:51] And so it's very nice to, to actually meet the people you work with and the people you

[01:56] chat to on Slack day to day.

[01:57] Yeah, man.

[01:58] Uh, and it's funny, like once a week we have an all hands, it's, it's little hands.

[02:03] We like only 30 people, but all hands team week, it's called every Tuesday morning where

[02:08] the entire company jumps on zoom for half an hour and we go through of formal stuff,

[02:14] like client stream updates.

[02:15] And then we go through it less formal.

[02:18] Someone takes a turn to do like a demo of something mostly sometimes client updates,

[02:24] but sometimes also like a random demo, like how to build a backyard shed or some, some

[02:29] stuff that, that are really interesting.

[02:30] And uh, it's what, like over the, the weeks more and more people dropped off that thing

[02:36] and it became more like a chore and people are like, ah, everyone loves it.

[02:40] But you like working remote, you inevitably start drifting into this like, yeah, cool

[02:45] little square with people's faces and we give updates and it's, it loses that connectivity

[02:52] stuff and we, part of the, the retreat we did where we spent maybe half an hour of the

[02:58] first day trying to work out how can we improve the format of this thing to bring us back

[03:02] together again?

[03:03] Because the whole idea is like be together as a team.

[03:06] It's not necessarily like get updates from the latest clients and like the business stuff.

[03:13] And turns out, it turns out the number one remedy from what we, there's strategies, but

[03:19] the main one that you cannot replace is actually spend time together as humans doing non-work,

[03:25] doing human things like having a meal, having a hike, having a drink, whatever, like doing

[03:30] stuff together that is not work related and is not screen, digital two dimension related.

[03:38] And we had the team week yesterday because today's Wednesday and everyone was so like,

[03:44] sometimes people have their camera off or they're muted and everyone was camera and

[03:48] talking with the mic on and laughing and just interject, like jumping into conversation

[03:53] and roasting each other and all the, all the stuff that good friends tend to do.

[03:58] And we literally didn't change the format.

[04:00] We just like, everyone had spent quality time together and it was like, Oh, we have this

[04:05] zoom meeting with the good friends that I've seen.

[04:07] I've seen their legs.

[04:08] I've seen behind their back.

[04:09] Yeah.

[04:10] That was the thing that surprised me the most meeting everyone at Superbase is like the

[04:14] different proportions.

[04:15] Cause you only see like this, this same square cut out every single time.

[04:20] And so seeing like how tall people actually were is a, is really surprising.

[04:25] Yeah.

[04:26] It's really cool.

[04:27] And also like you use your brain starts to assimilate the, Oh, this person lives in this

[04:31] box with a staircase and a, and it's got a, it's got a rubber duck and it'll be the plan

[04:36] then.

[04:37] And then you see them like in the same room as you at a dinner table.

[04:40] And it's just like, you're just reminded, even if you knew, but you reminded that they're

[04:45] humans and they have other things in life than their little zoom set up.

[04:50] And yeah.

[04:51] So, so it was amazing.

[04:53] So just to give you a quick overview, that was a three day, but really two, two days

[04:59] event.

[05:00] But you arrived as a, as an expat from Sydney myself, I arrived on Wednesday night and left

[05:07] on Saturday morning, but the day was Thursday, Friday.

[05:10] And so the first day was something called share back.

[05:14] And it's basically after living it, it, what the best way to describe it is like a very

[05:20] informal internal conference.

[05:23] So it felt, it felt like there's a speaker lineup, there's an opening keynote, closing

[05:27] keynote, and then everyone has a time slot, but it's intentionally very stripped back.

[05:33] Like if you don't want, no one was expected to prepare something, just find a topic that

[05:38] you want to share back.

[05:40] It can be skills.

[05:41] I picked video editing cause I like it and I think it was really well received, but some

[05:46] folks picked like completely non-technical topic, like I've used the backyard shed one,

[05:53] one person literally assembled a backyard shed and had to dig a trench to, to put the

[05:58] cables in.

[05:59] That was the presentation.

[06:01] We had a fantastic wine tasting session to close out the day.

[06:06] That was the closing keynote by one of our engineers.

[06:10] And she's finishing a degree in wineology and like, like proper, that's not a real word.

[06:18] That's a lie.

[06:19] That's a made up word.

[06:21] Well, she's studying at university, studying wine.

[06:24] And she's also finishing a sommelier certificate.

[06:29] So she's like, she did the whole wine tasting and what one pairs with what and try to blind,

[06:35] not blindfold, but like close your eyes and try to figure out what sort of stuff are in

[06:40] wine and then teaching us about how different wines are made.

[06:43] And that was super cool.

[06:44] So we did this first day and I was like, it's literally cause there is some phenomenal people

[06:50] in the ThinkMill team and you saw the lineup and you was almost like, Hey, that's like

[06:55] a tech conference.

[06:56] But then it was no cameras, no shit.

[06:59] Well, we took photos, but like no external people, just us sitting in a circle of chairs

[07:05] and really casual and people were welcome to ask questions and interrupt and roast and

[07:11] all the, all the good stuff you would do in a, in a more like safe space, a closed circle

[07:16] rather than like a real conference.

[07:19] But the quality of the presentations and the food between the sessions, it was, it was

[07:25] very much like going to web directions or Epic web conf.

[07:28] But yeah, I was thinking this is probably very similar to the group of people that was

[07:32] at React Conf Sydney before everyone else arrived.

[07:36] Yeah, pretty much.

[07:38] It felt, or I don't know if you went, there was a really small code heart design conference

[07:44] organized by the, again, people at ThinkMill.

[07:48] It felt like a high quality polished thing, but also there was like, everyone had 10 or

[07:53] 15 minutes and the first person took about half an hour and just getting roasted by everyone

[07:58] to cut it short.

[07:59] And then there was like intentional like casualness to it, but it still didn't distract from everyone

[08:08] had their time to present and it was super cool, super cool.

[08:12] So that was the first day.

[08:13] So it's, it's kind of like a, it's not a work day at all, but it's still sort of people

[08:19] amplifying each other with their skills and interest and bring this network of like interest

[08:26] and like, Oh, this person likes this, maybe we should talk about this, which was the seeds

[08:30] planted for the next day.

[08:32] That was really carefully crafted, I think, because this happened all the first day.

[08:36] And then people went to sleep, like, like if you go to a conference, it's exhausting.

[08:40] You're like, Oh my God, what a day.

[08:42] Go to sleep.

[08:43] And then the next morning we all met at the Sydney central train station and caught a train

[08:48] to the Blue Mountains, which is about two hours, two hours, 10 minutes, precisely the

[08:53] train ride.

[08:55] And from, from the get go, you could like, people are ready to go hiking and stuff.

[08:59] And you, the whole, we just completely hijacked one full train carriage, which is about 30

[09:04] people capacity.

[09:06] And again, this was, this train was like a mini conference meetup.

[09:10] Like everyone was talking about the different topics from the day before.

[09:13] And like, you could see that the, the seed they had planted completely worked instead

[09:18] of people.

[09:19] It's a hallway track, but it's in the middle of a moving train.

[09:22] Exactly what it was.

[09:23] It's a railway, railway track.

[09:24] I don't know why I didn't make that joke.

[09:29] That's, that's too obvious.

[09:32] You can edit and pretend you found that one.

[09:35] But it's like the training track.

[09:37] Yeah.

[09:38] The main train track.

[09:40] It was amazing.

[09:41] Like you, you could see that instead of saying, Oh, how's, how's, what project are you working?

[09:47] Like, are you, what state management are you using?

[09:48] Like people were like going completely in different topics related to the day before.

[09:53] And so we went to this place, everyone knows Katoomba, which is the main place in the blue

[09:58] mountains, but there's a, there is like little village right next week.

[10:03] I can't remember the name now.

[10:05] Fairy meadow, maybe something blue meadow, something meadow, meadow blue, whatever.

[10:10] Blue meadow would be appropriate given that it's at the foot of the blue mountains.

[10:13] Yeah.

[10:14] True.

[10:15] Now maybe blue is because of blue mountains.

[10:16] It's probably fairy meadow.

[10:17] I don't know.

[10:18] I don't want to look it up.

[10:19] But, uh, there's a, there's a really fancy, uh, very old and fancy hotel right on the,

[10:26] so the blue mountains is like, uh, everything is elevated.

[10:30] And then the mountains actually go down instead of up, like you're at the top.

[10:33] And then there's an escarpment and it just drops down.

[10:36] And the hotel was like literally built on the ridge.

[10:40] So if you went on the balcony, you just see like this drop and like bushlands till like,

[10:45] it feels bigger than Europe of like trees everywhere.

[10:49] I'm from Switzerland and mountains are like kind of close and cornered and there was like

[10:54] wide open.

[10:55] And we stayed in this place called the Hydro Majestic, which is overly fancy and old.

[11:00] Like there's piano and ballrooms and stuff everywhere.

[11:03] And like, like older people, like that's a place I would never have gone by myself or

[11:09] with my family.

[11:10] Yeah, my family cannot afford to stay in that place.

[11:13] The price and also the sort of interest, like it's typically like older, more wealthy, more

[11:20] like interested in, uh, just like the mountain cruise.

[11:26] It's funny you say that because as we walked through, it's a very long and narrow, again,

[11:31] like a train sort of hotel because it's on the cliff edge.

[11:34] And as you walk through, it's like different rooms with different vibes.

[11:38] And I kept, I kept walking and say, Oh, it feels like being on a cruise ship where you,

[11:42] you just walk.

[11:43] And then on the left, it feels like Titanic on the top floor where they have like seven

[11:47] forks and knives and they're eating all dressed up in suits with the piano.

[11:52] And then you go to the next one and it's a smoking room and it's all red and green and

[11:56] crazy.

[11:57] Yeah, that was super cool.

[12:00] But all that to say, uh, this second day we, we checked in the rooms after the train ride

[12:04] and we went hiking in the Blue Mountains.

[12:06] So imagine 30 designers and developers, not everyone is extremely like mountain goat fit

[12:14] and keen to.

[12:15] So that was a pretty simple hike, but then we did a second one for those who wanted more

[12:20] and then switched to board games.

[12:23] And then I had an amazing dinner again, one long table, a hallway track.

[12:28] And we've never done that concept and there was some chaos to it.

[12:31] But the whole idea was like, if you have one table, it sucks because you're sitting here

[12:35] and you've just have three persons for the whole dinner and you didn't choose and you're

[12:39] like, Oh, we never had time to talk.

[12:42] So the way it was organized is there was a three course meal.

[12:47] And between each meal, people had to grab their stuff they had started eating with and

[12:53] stand behind the chair and then be allocated a new place, completely randomized.

[12:58] And a couple of people were like, Oh, this is too much effort.

[13:01] But it was so cool because you start dinner, having the salad and having a chat with like

[13:05] the six, eight people you see kind of in your close proximity.

[13:09] And then you just get up and then you, Oh, this is a brand new, it's the same setup,

[13:13] but brand new faces.

[13:14] And it just kept going like this.

[13:17] And what I liked is, again, they planted the seed and then after the dinner was finished,

[13:21] some music started and drinks and whatever.

[13:23] And people kept just getting up and going somewhere else because they had kind of saw

[13:28] the benefit and the, Oh, this is so cool.

[13:30] You just jump into the next kind of segment of the discussion.

[13:34] So yeah.

[13:35] That's really cool.

[13:36] Like that they were so intentional about trying to mix up those groups.

[13:41] And it's, yeah, it's really, a really good idea starting with that kind of social presentation

[13:47] stuff right at the start where people are presenting about like, you know, things that

[13:51] they're interested in or things that they've been doing at home.

[13:53] It gives you all of this, like prompting to then have something to talk to those people

[13:58] about.

[13:59] So then when you're on the train, you're sitting with different people and you already might

[14:03] have some, some topics to talk about there.

[14:06] And then you're probably walking with a different group of people.

[14:09] And then there's dinner being like the first group that you sit down with and then randomizing

[14:13] all of it.

[14:14] Like it sounds like there was lots of opportunities to meet lots of different people.

[14:17] Cause yeah, usually if you have that kind of like, if it's more like a conference where

[14:22] you're like, you know, you have a table or whatever the allocated to.

[14:27] And then when you come back the next day, you're allocated to that same table.

[14:31] Like you're, you're talking to the same people over and over again.

[14:35] It's really nice to be so intentional about mixing up those groups and getting people,

[14:39] yeah.

[14:40] Talking to people they're not familiar with.

[14:41] Yeah.

[14:42] And if you, there's, humans have that thing that if you, if you sit at a table once and

[14:47] then you get up, no big deal.

[14:49] But if you sit again and you pick the second spot, the same spot again, from there on it's,

[14:54] you claim this is my spot.

[14:56] Like I don't know if you, if you do that at a conference, you, the first session you at

[15:00] a table and then you pick another one.

[15:01] There's no big deal.

[15:02] But if you do it twice, then you're like, okay, now I live here.

[15:05] I'm going to leave my bag and this I'm expecting the other people to be the same.

[15:09] And so by, by breaking off this mold, they kind of say, Hey, there's a better way to

[15:13] do this.

[15:14] Keep, keep just rotating.

[15:15] It would have been great if they had like set you all up with like, you need to plant

[15:21] the seed in other people, in your conversations about like specific, really niche things about

[15:26] your life, and then we're going to have like a big kind of like, or like a kind of trivia

[15:33] thing at the end where you get like a bingo card of, of people that you need to allocate

[15:38] to particular, like really weird things that they're able to do.

[15:43] That's a great idea.

[15:44] Man, today we actually filled a form about like how we could improve for next, next year.

[15:49] That's, that's a really good idea.

[15:50] And they were like, can you think of other ways to kind of encourage a mingling and then

[15:56] kind of like a reward, like in a funny, like what you described is exactly that.

[16:01] Uh, yes.

[16:02] Uh, Brent, I was talking about the Hydro Majestic.

[16:04] That's where we stayed.

[16:05] I knew nothing about it until last week and yeah, it's a pretty cool place.

[16:10] For the audio listeners, Simon just pulled up a comment from the, from the live audience.

[16:14] I forgot that we, not everyone, almost no one is watching live.

[16:18] Uh, although I see 105 people, but that's probably people clicking on.

[16:23] So you can see there's a comment from a Twitter, from Brent, and then there's a comment from

[16:27] YouTube, and we are streaming both on YouTube and Twitter and it's, it's pretty cool, uh,

[16:33] that the comments come, uh, both mixed.

[16:36] Thanks for joining.

[16:37] So yeah, this was my last week.

[16:40] I know that was a short question and long answer, but this, this was a very special

[16:45] week.

[16:46] Uh, and anyone listening that works remote and is trying to, I know every remote company

[16:50] is like, Oh, we need to find ways to make people feel connected and create games and

[16:55] stuff.

[16:56] Uh, man, one thing that came the first day was this concept of mandatory fun.

[17:01] It was like, like if you say, Hey, we're organizing this thing, you should join.

[17:05] No one joins.

[17:06] You almost have to force people to do it and then they might like it.

[17:09] Uh, but then again, if you do this, then it, it wears out really quickly.

[17:14] So it sucks because it costs a lot of money for companies, but organizing and in-person

[17:19] stuff and making it as focused on human aspects and not work aspects is the golden recipe.

[17:27] Like if this gathering was like, Hey, let's, let's, uh, ultimately the team wants us to

[17:32] work better together and be more performant and happier.

[17:36] And it definitely did this.

[17:37] But if, if it was all focused on like, let's hone in on how we do the design to dev handover

[17:42] and everything was all related to how we work together, I feel like, uh, it would have a

[17:47] better impact short, short term on like team, uh, collaboration, but like the whole.

[17:53] Damn, man, I, I feel connected to this team and I love the people I work with this.

[17:57] This is why it makes you wake up in the morning and wants to do your best work way more than,

[18:02] Oh yeah, I know that I should communicate my intent on Figma with like a little post-it

[18:06] note, whatever.

[18:07] Yeah, for sure.

[18:08] And also having such variety in it, like if you just had, uh, you know, one type of thing

[18:13] that you were doing over and over again, some people would really enjoy that and engage

[18:18] with that.

[18:19] And then other people would be like, I don't, I don't, I don't care about this.

[18:22] Um, and so having those like different, having the, like, you know, some work slash tech

[18:27] focused talk stuff, some personal life talk stuff, a like walk outside and more of like

[18:34] physical activity and then board games and strategic stuff, uh, like having those, those

[18:39] different, um, categories of things that you're doing that different people might engage with

[18:45] more or less, um, is a really good way to, to bring people together.

[18:49] And I imagine like, again, find people that are interested in similar sort of stuff.

[18:53] Like you're doing a walk and you're like, why are all these guys stuck back here?

[18:58] Let's go to the top.

[18:59] Why are they walking so slowly?

[19:01] And then you realize that, you know, there are some other people you work with who are

[19:04] really into bushwalks and fitness and things.

[19:07] Um, or if you're playing board games and you realize like someone else is super, super

[19:11] strategic and taking it way too seriously, which is what I would be if I, uh, if I had

[19:17] joined, I love board games and get way too serious and way too strategic about it.

[19:21] Uh, and so you might realize that there's someone else, uh, who's, who's very similar

[19:25] that you can, you have more to talk about at work and, you know, you might catch up

[19:30] with them outside of work and make a new friend.

[19:32] Yep.

[19:33] And I gotta say one more thing, the, the, the order of doing these conferences thing

[19:38] first and then go outside, do some activities was phenomenal.

[19:42] And if you, I don't know about you, but when I think about my experience going at conferences

[19:46] is after, after the conference is where you have all these ideas, you want to talk to

[19:51] people.

[19:52] And typically there's a dinner where people get very drunk and then you don't really talk

[19:57] about something very interesting.

[19:58] And then everyone goes home or there's, there's, uh, whatever, like everyone leaves straight

[20:03] away.

[20:04] Or a DJ playing really, really loudly and you've got a bunch of like introverted tech

[20:07] people that are like shifting further and further away from the DJ trying to find a

[20:11] quiet corner where they're not feeling overwhelmed.

[20:13] Yeah, exactly.

[20:14] Or like karaoke or like stuff that, that is great, but it's, it kind of, it takes away

[20:19] from like the, the follow-up conversation, hallway track thing.

[20:24] And for me, when I went to Epic Web Con, for example, in the after party, I was still drained

[20:31] from my talk and the whole energy drain.

[20:34] And I talked to a few people, but I kind of like folded back to my, Oh, I know these people

[20:38] already.

[20:39] I don't have to do small talk and mingle and stuff.

[20:41] But then we went snowboarding the next day and this is where like the, like the completes

[20:46] you out in the nature.

[20:48] And that's when you're like, this is the perfect way to do a follow-up conversation.

[20:53] When you see people under a different angle, they're, they're not wearing the like a company

[20:58] t-shirt and the microphone and like the typical dev stuff that I can, the snowboard gear or

[21:03] like the hiking.

[21:04] And you realize, Oh, they're really sporty or they're, they're, that's, that's when you

[21:07] start talking about hobbies and human aspects.

[21:10] And so doing something outdoors that involve exercise and intentionally no tech gear, no

[21:16] phones or like, I wouldn't do like a orienteering thing where you have an iPad app and you have

[21:21] to go and tap and solve, like it would create a nerdy thing.

[21:24] But the whole idea of like, Hey, leave computer, like, you know how every time you meet a dev,

[21:29] they have a backpack and you know, they have a laptop and like this, this part is taken

[21:33] away intentionally.

[21:34] And I thought that was the best and most retreats should definitely consider this because we

[21:40] spend our lives glued to the screen.

[21:44] So getting outside and touching grass literally is, it turns out to be a great thing.

[21:49] For sure.

[21:50] Yeah.

[21:51] They were definitely the most enjoyable times for me as well at the, at the super base offsite

[21:57] was yeah.

[21:58] Just the time hanging out outside of outside of the organized activities.

[22:03] Yeah.

[22:04] Simon's, do you want to describe what you're doing visually?

[22:12] I'm ignoring John as he talks because Brent in the comments saw that I'm wearing the manly

[22:17] basketball hoodie.

[22:19] I used to play and coach and my kids used to play in Manly.

[22:22] We used to live in Manly or Nairobi.

[22:25] And Brent just mentioned that he lives in Manly.

[22:28] It's a Northern beaches of Sydney.

[22:31] So really nice place, quite busy for my liking, but yeah, it's great.

[22:36] When I was younger and kid free and responsibility free, I absolutely adored living there.

[22:40] You can catch a ferry to the city, you can walk everywhere.

[22:44] Just stuff happening, beautiful beach, beautiful surf, a little headland with like little possums

[22:51] and wallabies.

[22:52] And it's, it's awesome.

[22:53] This episode brought to you by Manly beaches, but yeah, the, something that I really enjoyed

[23:02] about the, about the super base offsite was it was it, it was in Thailand, so everyone

[23:09] in the company was there in Thailand and there's certain foods that you should be a little

[23:18] bit careful about eating in Thailand and drinking the water directly from the tap can make some

[23:25] people sick.

[23:27] So basically most of the team was getting sick in some way throughout the week.

[23:33] And so I came up with this awesome idea of creating an app or like a game where you,

[23:40] you get points for not getting sick.

[23:44] So if you, every day that you spend not throwing up or having diarrhea or some kind of sickness

[23:51] or a sore stomach, every, every day that you make it through, you get a certain number

[23:56] of points, but you also get more points for the riskier food that you eat.

[24:02] And so you've got this incentive to take some risks with some like really delicious street

[24:08] food.

[24:09] That's going to be like the most incredible thing you've eaten, but you know, might come

[24:12] back to haunt you later in the night.

[24:15] And so, yeah, the, the most fun I had was like pitching this idea to everyone that I

[24:21] was talking to anytime we were like sitting down for dinner or like out somewhere in between

[24:26] an activity we were doing just brainstorming the idea of how this app could be built and

[24:32] how you could kind of reward points for not getting sick, but also incentivize people

[24:37] to take risks with delicious food.

[24:38] It was a lot of fun.

[24:41] That's amazing.

[24:42] Did anyone go for the Hail Mary and tried like uncooked seafood?

[24:45] Well, that was the highest tier was like, like chicken sashimi.

[24:51] If you can, if you can eat raw chicken in Thailand and survive the, to tell the tale,

[24:58] then you win the game.

[24:59] We didn't actually end up deploying it just from, you know, ran out of time to actually

[25:04] build it.

[25:05] But all of the like talking about how it would be built was a lot of fun.

[25:09] This is great, man.

[25:10] You've got great ideas.

[25:11] On a serious note though, part of what we're trying to do with this gathering and post

[25:17] gathering is like find ways to, to improve the, how we do remotely.

[25:22] Like Thinkmill has been working remote for a while and I joined as a remote first employee

[25:27] who would show up in the office once a month or so before COVID was a thing.

[25:32] And at the time, most people were in the office, but they were very open to people working

[25:37] from anywhere.

[25:38] Like Thinkmill is the most furthest away from the company where the founders wants to control

[25:45] their people and ass in chair.

[25:46] And like, I want to know that you start at 8am and punch in the, like, it's a collective

[25:52] of really self-driven and directed humans that trust each other.

[25:57] And so there's, there was never this like, Oh, but I don't, if you're working home, I

[26:01] don't know if you're watching YouTube or doing whatever, but yeah, I actually watch YouTube

[26:07] because this is my job.

[26:08] Twitter and YouTube, that's 90% of where I spend my day because I need to research.

[26:14] But yeah, we've identified that with people in the office and then people remote that

[26:20] you have to put certain things in place.

[26:22] Otherwise the remote people always miss out because decisions are made in the office and

[26:26] the context is missing.

[26:27] So we, we, I was helping the team actually.

[26:31] One of my jobs early before COVID was to help Thinkmill work better remote and sort of move

[26:37] to remote first, even if people are in the office and like, just do stuff you would do

[26:42] remotely, even if you're in the office, if that makes sense, like try to move the source

[26:46] of truth and communication, everything somewhere in Notion instead of like on the whiteboard.

[26:52] And it started as silly as taking a screenshot photo of the whiteboard and then putting in

[26:56] Notion so people can see it, but I've helped put stuff in place and, uh, funnily or not

[27:01] funny enough COVID hit and we were like, Oh shit, we have to, we, we are now remote only

[27:08] because of not a choice, but a life design.

[27:12] And it turns out that's what we had put in place kind of helped, but now like long tail

[27:17] after all this, where people went back to the office purely for a social slash preference

[27:24] slash my house has screaming kids and the office is a beautiful air conditioned space,

[27:29] which is where I can do good work.

[27:31] Uh, but we're trying to, we're trying to find ways to make this remote company as good as

[27:38] possible working remotely.

[27:40] And one of the discussion topics was sort of exactly what you kind of described.

[27:46] We were like, we recognize that we need to intentionally bring more of our, uh, human

[27:52] aspects to, to work like it's the cliche, bring your whole self to work.

[27:57] But like the, that don't just talk about work and codes and nerd stuff because everyone

[28:02] has different interests.

[28:04] And when you bring them, uh, it kind of like people exactly how we did the share day, like

[28:09] you discover new aspects and have conversations.

[28:11] So we're looking for ways to have incentives for people to, to share more, like, because

[28:18] we have these channels, like makers channel where people talk about woodworking and we

[28:22] have this, um, music channels where people share what we try to have all these social

[28:27] channels are slack is a, the big, like main center, like, like, like city square center,

[28:35] whatever, where people hang out.

[28:37] But we, we want to find a way to kind of incentivize and then reward, like you were saying, like,

[28:43] maybe like a little gamification where if someone shares something about the weekend

[28:48] and then like it'll tip on how to like a cooking recipe or whatever, they just get some points.

[28:53] And then at the end of a term or whatever, we have like some tallies and like scoreboards

[28:57] and leaderboards.

[28:58] And that's, I think what you described with the app is pretty much exactly this, but like

[29:03] in a, in a distributed normal work life, not during a retreat, but during the day to day

[29:08] life, that would be cool to put in place some sort of like little quest that if you, if

[29:13] you go fulfill these things, you, you score five points or seven points and then you,

[29:17] you end up like the winner gets some, some sort of like prize or yeah, that'd be really

[29:21] cool to put in place.

[29:23] I actually started building a similar thing to this when, when, when our second child

[29:31] came along once we had to, everything became a little bit more challenging and like the

[29:39] time, the time that we had to like quality time we had to spend with, you know, all the

[29:46] different people in the family became a little bit more challenging.

[29:50] And so I started building an app that was similar to that, but for being a good dad

[29:56] or just being a good friend or a good partner or whatever.

[30:01] And so had like a list of different, like just small things that I could do, like just

[30:07] like, you know, look someone in the eye and give them a cuddle or like it could go all

[30:13] the way to like, you know, go, go for a walk to the playground and play for an hour or

[30:17] whatever, or, you know, go, I don't know, make homemade pizza or something, all these

[30:23] different, like I thought of all of these different activities that I do with my kids

[30:29] or with my partner and then broke it up into like little, like points essentially.

[30:35] Like is this like, you know, just a small thing that I can do really quickly?

[30:39] Is it a medium thing or is it like a big all day large thing?

[30:44] Which sounds kind of gross.

[30:45] Like there's one aspect of it where it's like gamified parenting and like only spend time

[30:50] with your kids to get points, which is gross, but the, you know, the intention behind it

[30:55] was like, there isn't much time.

[30:58] And so having a list of all of these things that we could do allocated to different blocks

[31:02] of time meant that if we just had like half an hour until the next thing, there's like

[31:08] a small thing that I could do.

[31:10] And the reward is, you know, like a much closer connection with your kid or your partner or

[31:14] whoever.

[31:15] So, yeah, it's a good way to be intentional about that kind of stuff.

[31:21] It's amazing.

[31:22] Like you said, it may sound gross, like, oh cool, you need an incentive to be a good parent,

[31:28] but at the same time, like we have all these, that's how you educate kids.

[31:32] You have the little stickers and stuff and then you have reward and you get five stickers

[31:37] and you can go watch a movie or whatever.

[31:40] And that's how you build habits.

[31:41] You kind of reinforce positive behavior and this should not stop with adulthood because

[31:47] we tend to forget, even if we know being a good parent is like putting the fun away and

[31:52] spend time with the kids.

[31:54] But sometimes if you're not reminded, you're going to miss opportunities to scratch that

[31:59] little habit and say, hey, I had five minutes, I could have just done this instead of randomly

[32:04] scrolling Twitter or just finding some gardening stuff to do to keep like, I really, really

[32:09] like this.

[32:11] And yeah, like basically, I forgot how it's called, but this rewards app, basically like

[32:18] it's like a habits, reinforcing, positing, reinforcing stuff.

[32:23] Yeah.

[32:24] Yeah.

[32:25] Just one thing.

[32:26] It's like having a prompt to remind you because the default, when there is no time is that,

[32:30] you know, you just do what you need to do.

[32:31] And so having something that can, you know, a list of small things that you can do in

[32:37] that, that small amount of time you have.

[32:40] And a big one was yet putting the phone away.

[32:42] Like if I noticed that I was looking at my phone or another quick parenting tip, if you,

[32:49] if you do find that you're looking at your phone too much, when you, when you want to

[32:53] be spending more like engaged time with your kids, putting my phone on, if you triple click

[33:00] on the, I think, I think it's by default.

[33:02] If you triple click on an iPhone, then it goes into like black and white mode.

[33:06] Oh yeah.

[33:07] Um, and so, uh, you can, I noticed that, uh, I'm more aware when I look at my phone because

[33:16] it looks weird because it's black and white.

[33:18] Um, reminder.

[33:19] Yeah.

[33:20] Yeah.

[33:21] Cause I think like by default it's too easy to just like, Oh, like we're going to go outside.

[33:24] What's the weather today or whatever.

[33:26] And you look at your phone and you look at the weather and then you accidentally or without

[33:31] thinking about it, open Twitter and then you'd spend a whole bunch of time just, yeah, the,

[33:35] the attention just gets taken by something.

[33:37] Um, and so having the screen black and white, uh, means I'm more aware of like, I'm actually

[33:43] looking at my phone because it looks strange because it's black and white.

[33:47] And behind the scenes is a whole bunch of psychology stuff about like, you know, um,

[33:52] things are designed with particular colors to, to grab your attention.

[33:57] And so by having it black and white, it's not as interesting to look at.

[34:00] So you don't get those like dopamine things firing off while you're looking at your phone.

[34:04] Um, but it also makes me more aware of the fact that I'm looking at it when maybe I don't

[34:09] want to intentionally be looking at it.

[34:12] This is great stuff, man.

[34:13] Uh, this is also like in terms of UX and UI, like disabled, uh, elements are usually grayed

[34:20] out or kind of like the saturation is taken away exactly for what you said.

[34:23] It's like less attention grabby and, uh, we can assimilate this thing as, Oh, it's, it's

[34:29] currently like off, offline or like not interactable, interactive or evasionable.

[34:35] Yeah.

[34:36] Um, I just want to circle back to one thing cause it made me giggle while you, you were

[34:40] like, Oh, it's like, there's a small task, like putting your phone away, it's five points.

[34:44] And then there's a task like taking the dogs for a walk.

[34:47] It's two hours, maybe 10 points.

[34:49] And if you want really gross it out that the incentive, it sounds like you're making agile

[34:54] and story points for your family life.

[34:57] So maybe you can have a family scrum master with like backlog grooming and, and how did

[35:03] we do this sprint?

[35:04] All right, family.

[35:05] Let's have a retroactive.

[35:06] How do we, or retrospective?

[35:08] Let's see.

[35:09] How did we do, uh, this last week?

[35:11] Does everyone feel closer to each other or further away?

[35:14] As a father, I want to, you know, I can point out I'm winning.

[35:19] I'm at the top of the leaderboard.

[35:21] So, uh, this is what you all need to do to get up to this point.

[35:25] Uh, but, uh, in all seriousness, uh, what we're trying to solve at ThinkMeal is what

[35:31] everyone's trying to solve since COVID basically, unless they bring everyone back to the office,

[35:36] but then it's another sort of set of problems.

[35:39] You just fire everyone who's not near the office, which at ThinkMeal would be more than

[35:42] half the company probably.

[35:44] And also I don't think everyone, anyone wants to force people to do that.

[35:48] But I was thinking like, if we, if we find a nice way to gamify the, the social involvement

[35:56] of people bringing more aspects of their lives and fun quirks and stuff, it's an amazing

[36:02] internal product, but it's also probably an amazing, uh, product that people would pay

[36:08] money for.

[36:09] Like when you're like, Oh, I want to build a SaaS app.

[36:11] I don't have an idea.

[36:12] It seems like a very cool idea of like, uh, and I'm saying this, I'm sure that there's

[36:18] companies that do exactly that Slack in a way kind of does that, but that kind of try

[36:22] to bring people together.

[36:25] The other app I'm thinking of is gather.com, uh, which I use for my, my, uh, workshops

[36:31] with Epic web, which is this real, a fake, fake, real world, real representation of a

[36:37] fake representation of a real world where you have your headquarters with different

[36:42] rooms and office and desks and people actually just log in and they walk to the table and

[36:47] they see who's here and they can go by the water cooler or just like, kind of have, it's

[36:51] kind of like zoom, but you have a physical little person that you customize to look like

[36:56] yourself or whatever you want.

[36:58] And there's that presence in the place.

[37:00] So like you can have a skate park in the corner and just hang out and it doesn't change anything.

[37:06] You still at home behind your stupid computer, but you can pretend, Hey, I'm a cool skater

[37:11] and I'm kind of flagging to the world.

[37:13] I like skateboarding and outdoors by cheating there.

[37:16] Uh, yeah, it's all this little gamification that can, uh, kind of try to say, Hey, remind

[37:22] people we humans and we have a physical presence and let's remember that instead of just another

[37:28] zoom meeting.

[37:29] And then, then you confuse the frustration of remote work and zoom calls and the, the,

[37:35] the energy drain of all these zoom calls.

[37:37] And then you forget that there are real people behind each little square.

[37:41] I don't know.

[37:43] This is a great topic though.

[37:44] Yeah.

[37:45] I think that this idea can be applied to, to so many things where you, um, like if you

[37:50] want to incentivize yourself to do something, yeah, you're right.

[37:54] It's just habits.

[37:55] Like it's developing habits.

[37:56] And so you could apply it to like, you know, your work slack.

[38:00] And so you want to reach out to people more often.

[38:03] So you develop a system where you get some points or whatever for like every, every week

[38:09] you reach out to someone to catch up for coffee, someone that you don't, you don't see very

[38:13] often.

[38:14] Um, or you just, you know, you choose to compliment someone once a week, you decide I'm going

[38:21] to find someone who's done something cool and I'm just going to shout them out publicly

[38:24] and say, Oh, well, privately or whatever, just reach out to them and say, it was really

[38:28] cool that you did this and that's going to like, you know, slowly build up a nicer relationship.

[38:35] But yeah, I just like, I find it so hard to do this remotely.

[38:40] Like, um, like you're talking about, it works really well when you get together and you

[38:45] actually meet these people and it's just, it's just different to online.

[38:49] Even when you're trying to do these things, like you can, you can do some foundational

[38:52] building of, you know, um, of, of culture and respect and, um, appreciation and gratitude

[38:59] and all of that stuff.

[39:00] Um, but it's just like seeing people in person is just a whole different thing.

[39:06] Like I remember when COVID kicked off, there was lots of, I was at, um, realestate.com.au

[39:13] at the time.

[39:14] Um, Australia's leading real estate company, real estate listing.

[39:20] Yeah.

[39:21] Uh, and I, um, we were like really intentional about trying to like, you know, play games

[39:28] on a Friday afternoon, like remote games on a Friday afternoon and have these and stuff.

[39:33] Um, and it just, like, like you were saying before, like it becomes this mandatory thing,

[39:39] like initially it's fun and it has this novelty, but then it just like becomes this.

[39:43] It becomes another zoom meeting and it's Friday afternoon and you're like, oh, more time on

[39:47] zoom.

[39:48] I honestly rather kick the ball with my son or walk the dog.

[39:51] Yeah, it's totally like, that's going to make me feel more engaged at work is not being

[39:55] at work and going and spending time with my family, doing something different away from

[39:59] this screen and then coming back and feeling refreshed.

[40:02] Um, and so it's really like, you know, there are, it's definitely important to, to intentionally

[40:07] do some things to, to, to make it a more positive community that you're working in.

[40:13] But it's, yeah, it's really hard to replicate remotely, I think just occasionally you need

[40:19] that time, like once a year, once every six months where you just get everyone together,

[40:23] whether that be your workplace and get everyone together.

[40:25] Or if it's like a conference that you and a whole bunch of people in your like online

[40:29] community decide to go to this specific conference and you can all hang out in person.

[40:33] Uh, just, yeah.

[40:35] Makes such a difference.

[40:36] Yeah.

[40:37] Uh, so when are you coming to Melbourne, Simon, when are you coming to see me?

[40:41] Yeah.

[40:42] We need, uh, we need, uh, one day where we share each other's, uh, recording techniques

[40:48] and then we go hiking behind your house in the state forest.

[40:52] I like this.

[40:53] That would be lovely.

[40:55] I wanted to say something that, uh, yes, incentives and game.

[41:02] Yeah.

[41:03] We, we, we had that point of like mandatory fun because we need to force people and that's,

[41:07] that doesn't work at all.

[41:08] So that's why I think finding a way to gamify stuff and make people accidentally do the

[41:14] right thing because there's a little benefit or like a little reminder is the way.

[41:19] And I just thought while you were saying that, like, cause I know exactly the feeling we

[41:22] have this squad lunch where the company pays for everyone to order lunch once a month.

[41:27] So we have 30 people and then the squads of four or five people that kind of look after

[41:31] each other as a more like atomic level, which I think is really cool.

[41:35] It says nothing to do with work.

[41:37] Most people in the squad work on different projects, but it's more like little buddy

[41:41] system where like if, if you, something's not right, you just got a little network to

[41:46] tap into before like going to the whole team.

[41:50] And we have this squad lunch.

[41:52] Everyone's got a budget up to $30 to order lunch on Uber Eats or whatever.

[41:56] And then we go on zoom and we, for an hour, we just eat together.

[41:59] And sometimes we do cross squad lunches with like double squads.

[42:02] So it's eight people instead of four.

[42:05] And on paper, it sounds amazing, but like I was, it's always at lunchtime.

[42:09] And typically when you work remote, you work really hard and you're like, oh, at lunch

[42:12] break, I'll go for a walk, take the dogs, go, go outside.

[42:16] And then you're like, ah, we have squad lunch.

[42:18] That means I have to be on zoom for an hour between 1230 and 130.

[42:23] And it becomes this thing that should be like a really nice team bonding stuff becomes like

[42:28] it is cool, but I'm going to be on zoom with the same people I would talk about work and

[42:33] we'll talk about something else, but it might go, like, it's just being on zoom and then

[42:37] you skip somewhat kind of skip the, you don't skip the lunch break cause you have a lunch

[42:41] break, but you skip the eyes rest and.

[42:44] Yeah, that's right.

[42:45] You get off the meeting and you're like, well, I need a break now.

[42:49] Break bracket is done.

[42:50] I want to get to this other stuff that I needed to do in the afternoon, but now I need a break

[42:54] from the screen.

[42:55] Like I need to go and get some fresh air and walk away.

[42:59] Look at something different.

[43:00] So sneaky.

[43:01] So everyone's like by one study is like, all right, I better jump in.

[43:04] I've got some work to do.

[43:05] I'll get a meeting.

[43:06] I get a jump on this call with the client and you can tell everyone's like, oh, but

[43:10] crap.

[43:11] Like I didn't have a actual, I had a nice lunch and I didn't have my break.

[43:16] So what I was thinking that crossed my mind is that, um, the incentive could be intentionally

[43:22] something that takes you away from the screen.

[43:24] So like some sort of like photo, photo competition or like if you nature, like a nature photo

[43:31] competition or like some hiking stuff or go, go take a photo of yourself in a place that

[43:36] you obviously have to hike a little bit to get to like this sort of stuff, like a almost

[43:41] like little quests, like everyone where they live, there's a few things that you can do.

[43:46] And maybe instead of giving $30 a month for people to have lunch and force them to eat

[43:51] while watching each other eat, uh, maybe do it once every three months and give them a

[43:56] hundred bucks and say, go do like a, I don't know what you can do with a hundred bucks,

[44:00] but you can do something cool.

[44:01] Maybe do paragliding or a hang gliding flight or something and just take a selfie and just

[44:07] do one cool thing.

[44:09] Uh, I think that there would be like, the key would be to incentivize people to do something

[44:14] that is completely not screens and technology related.

[44:18] So go cook a really nice meal and take a photo of like just stuff like this.

[44:23] I think that's a great idea.

[44:24] Yeah.

[44:25] Like is a hundred dollars.

[44:26] You can't keep the a hundred dollars.

[44:27] You have to spend as much as you can of the, of the budget on doing something.

[44:31] And so, yeah.

[44:32] Do you go and buy really fancy ingredients and make something really nice?

[44:35] Do you go and find like a, like we've got like a tree top, uh, obstacle course thing

[44:41] near us where you're like elevated up in the air, climbing on ropes and stuff like go and

[44:47] do something like that.

[44:48] It's a hundred bucks.

[44:49] Go and either do something close in your community and then take some photos and like tell a

[44:52] story to the team about it.

[44:54] Yeah.

[44:55] That's a fantastic idea.

[44:56] We had this, um, kind of similar when, when, when COVID happened, um, someone had this

[45:01] awesome idea of like, okay, REA or realestate.com.au is like a huge company in Australia, heaps

[45:09] of employees.

[45:10] They're spread all over Melbourne where we were, um, could we, like when, when we were

[45:16] in lockdown, everyone got locked down to a 5k radius.

[45:20] So five kilometers was as far as you could go from your house for like months.

[45:25] It was the longest lockdown in the entire world in Melbourne.

[45:28] Um, but yeah, there were, there were so many like little overlapping 5k radiuses that it

[45:35] was like, well, what if we have some like object, like, you know, uh, a little like

[45:44] award or something, a little like trophy.

[45:47] And what if we could like find out every overlapping 5k, um, in, in all of where everyone is and

[45:54] see if we can like do a relay race of like, of overlapping 5k distances to see how far

[46:02] we can travel this trophy from like one side all the way across the other.

[46:06] Does that make sense?

[46:07] Yeah.

[46:08] As in if someone's like 5k from someone else, they can hand over the trophy and then that

[46:12] person can go five, well, yeah, five K's back to their house.

[46:15] And then they also have five K's away from their house that they can go hand it to the

[46:18] next person.

[46:19] And then the next person was such a cool idea, but the whole point of COVID was to, or like

[46:23] the whole point of the lockdown was to, you know, get people to isolate from each other

[46:28] and not be close to each other.

[46:29] So it ended up getting shut down by the company, um, as not a good idea.

[46:33] Uh, yeah, maybe you can do the handover, like, yeah.

[46:38] Find a way to symbolize the handover by like, Oh, you can drop the pin or whatever.

[46:44] Just, you can prove that you're within like 50 meters from each other at this point in

[46:48] time and say like this, this is the COVID safe trophy handoff.

[46:53] Yeah.

[46:54] Yeah.

[46:55] That's a great idea.

[46:56] Uh, yeah.

[46:57] I think I want to lean in on that.

[46:58] This discussion we had today, I want to almost make the ThinkMill team listen to this episode

[47:03] because we, we trying to brainstorm, uh, ways to, to improve the mandatory fun.

[47:09] And I think really the, the key unlock, which is hard for tech companies is to do something

[47:14] not tech related intentionally because most other things will end up being a drawing game

[47:20] on the canvas, uh, on zoom.

[47:21] Like it's always result revolved to go on zoom and then do something together.

[47:26] But the, yeah.

[47:27] Reinforce like audio calls, walking, walking meetings and stuff like this.

[47:32] That's a good idea.

[47:33] Yeah.

[47:34] That's a really good idea.

[47:35] Walking and zoom without the camera, just put the audio and it can be a WhatsApp call

[47:39] or I miss it.

[47:40] Whatever.

[47:41] Whatever.

[47:42] Everything has, is call only.

[47:43] Even Twitter, you can do audio calls now.

[47:45] Um, yeah, just do a call and to go walk the dogs and not look at, not look at the screen

[47:51] and try to maintain the present to think what's what am I showing or just, yeah, I think I'm

[47:57] going to lean triple, triple lean on this.

[48:00] Um, look, this has been another episode where we wanted to talk about the future, but we

[48:04] have an intrinsic, I think today was great actually, this like natural topic of going

[48:09] from the, my remote retreats to how to do remotes in, in family, in work and how to

[48:15] incentivize being a better parent and disconnect from tech.

[48:19] Um, I do think we should move to, unless you've got something else on the peak, move to the

[48:24] sick pics that I don't have one, I'm just going to move to the section where I'm not

[48:30] going to engage.

[48:31] I do have a sick pic and it's kind of in, uh, in, in relation to what we've been talking

[48:37] about.

[48:38] I don't know.

[48:39] Which way do I go?

[48:40] They're both, they both kind of came to me as we were, as we were talking through the

[48:42] episode.

[48:43] Yep.

[48:44] Uh, I think I'm going to do this one.

[48:47] All right.

[48:48] Schedule your evenings.

[48:51] This is going to be another one that sounds gross initially, like giving yourself points

[48:56] for engaging with your children.

[48:58] That's, you know, that's gross on the surface level, but when you dig a little deeper, you

[49:02] know, the intention is, is good.

[49:03] So schedule your evenings.

[49:05] This is something that, um, me and my wife have only started doing like quite recently.

[49:11] Yeah.

[49:12] Um, but we found like we always default to doing the same thing.

[49:16] And so like, you know, there's very little time that we have after we put the kids to

[49:19] bed before we need to go to sleep so that we have had enough sleep to get woken up in

[49:24] the morning by our kids.

[49:25] So there's only like a small bracket of time, um, maybe like an hour or maybe two hours

[49:30] a night.

[49:31] That's a lot.

[49:32] Yeah.

[49:33] Okay.

[49:34] It's, it's really not that long.

[49:35] It's probably an hour a night.

[49:38] And so we always kind of default to just doing the same thing.

[49:41] Like if we're watching a TV show or whatever, then we just default to watching that.

[49:45] And when the NBA finals were happening, um, my team won the entire, uh, NBA championship.

[49:51] If anyone was wondering.

[49:52] Good job.

[49:53] We didn't even mention that.

[49:54] The three days after it happened.

[49:55] We haven't even talked about it.

[49:56] Oh no.

[49:57] All right.

[49:58] Next episode.

[49:59] A whole episode on basketball.

[50:00] That's what I know you're all waiting to hear.

[50:03] Uh, anyway, when the NBA finals were happening, um, me and my wife are both really into it.

[50:08] And so, um, because we only have that chunk of time, usually you're watching one game

[50:13] over like a few nights.

[50:14] But that just became the default was we would just watch that every single night.

[50:17] Um, and then when the finals ended, we were like, all right, we need to be more intentional

[50:22] about doing like a little bit more of a variety of things.

[50:26] And so we came up with like a list of different things that we enjoy doing.

[50:28] So like playing, um, like, uh, my sick pick from last week was, um, a game called boulders

[50:35] gate, which is awesome.

[50:36] Um, playing boulders gate or playing a board game or doing some exercise, doing like a

[50:42] online, like a YouTube video exercise routine thing, um, or watching a TV show, you know,

[50:49] coming up with some different things that we enjoy doing and then like allocating those

[50:54] two particular evenings.

[50:55] So on a Thursday we always do this thing on a Friday we always do this thing.

[51:00] Uh, and it's just like, it's, it's so, so much nicer, not just defaulting to like the

[51:07] thing where you're just an exhausted zombie and you just do the same thing over and over

[51:11] again.

[51:12] Um, I found it's much nicer, like you feel better cause you're being intentional about

[51:16] some other things that you want to do, like exercise and things like that.

[51:19] Um, but also just like feeling more engaged and closer to the person that you might want

[51:24] to spend some time with.

[51:25] So schedule your evenings, even if you're, even if you don't have a partner, if you don't

[51:30] have kids that take up all of your time, uh, just, you know, add some variety to life.

[51:36] Even if it's just like schedule your meals, like pick different things that you're going

[51:39] to cook, uh, do different things that are fun that you want to do that you never find

[51:45] the time to do.

[51:46] Awesome.

[51:47] I love how this is aligned with exactly what we were talking about before and being like

[51:52] almost gamified, not gamified, but like the, uh, by doing this, it's, it sounds like a

[51:57] boring amount of work to have a calendar for your private life and schedule things like

[52:02] you said, but what it does is it removes decision making on the day to day.

[52:07] So you wake up and you're like, Oh, cool.

[52:09] We having creamy mushroom pasta and then we playing this game.

[52:13] Okay.

[52:14] Yeah.

[52:15] That sounds cool.

[52:16] And then you do it instead of like doing these micro decisions that kind of wear you in life.

[52:20] Like kids go to school, but I get to think of dinner, but I get to start work.

[52:23] Let me answer an email.

[52:24] And then maybe during lunch break, I'll think of what I'm cooking tonight.

[52:27] And just like chaos ensues of all that.

[52:30] So having plan and doesn't probably take very long.

[52:34] Every family has three, four, five go-to meals, and then you just rotate them, allocate them

[52:38] to specific dates.

[52:39] It helps with the shopping as well, because you know what you need for this week.

[52:43] Uh, yeah, this is, this is pro tip of being an adult, I guess, plan.

[52:49] It was after we decided to do this as, as, you know, validation for what we had done.

[52:53] But, um, there's this thing about, um, pre committing to things.

[52:58] And so, um, if you like, if there's things that you want to do, so exercise is a good

[53:01] example.

[53:02] Like, you know, I want to exercise, I'll exercise three nights a week, but I won't like pick

[53:07] those nights.

[53:08] I'll just decide each night.

[53:09] Like right now, do I feel like exercising or do I not surprise, surprise, you will not

[53:14] do it.

[53:15] Surprise, surprise.

[53:16] You'd be like, well, tomorrow night will be the one of three nights or whatever, or the

[53:19] next night.

[53:20] Um, and so by like pre committing to things and allocating it with specific nights saying,

[53:25] I've already made this decision on Tuesday night, I'm going to go for a walk for half

[53:29] an hour, or I'm going to go to the gym or whatever, um, picking that you do that on

[53:35] that specific night means you've already made that decision and you've already pre committed

[53:38] to it.

[53:39] And you are so much more likely to stick to it when you're not just kind of making the

[53:44] decision in the moment you're presented with like, Ooh, I have half an hour until I need

[53:49] to go to bed.

[53:50] Am I going to exercise tonight?

[53:51] No, I'll exercise tomorrow.

[53:53] So pre committing to things makes you much more likely to actually see it through.

[53:58] In fact, uh, yes, yesterday I had this exact dilemma, like I, um, I didn't do any exercise

[54:06] and then the evening I was like, Oh, it's eight 30.

[54:09] Maybe I can go for a quick half an hour, one hour walk with the dogs and it's dark and

[54:13] it's cold.

[54:14] And there's so many reasons not to do it.

[54:16] And obviously I did not do it now tonight, like every Wednesday and it's the case Monday

[54:22] as well.

[54:23] It helps cause it's a team sport, but I have basketball schedule.

[54:26] Like I have, I play in teams.

[54:27] We are in the championship with like scheduled games.

[54:31] Not once.

[54:32] Am I going to be, I don't really feel like playing basketball.

[54:34] It's Wednesday.

[54:35] You go play basketball.

[54:36] You finish work at five, cook dinner, five 30, leave the house, go play basketball for

[54:40] two hours.

[54:42] Family eats while I play.

[54:43] Come back.

[54:44] I eat my own meal.

[54:45] This is what we do.

[54:46] And when I look forward to every Wednesday, because there's the nav bar same with the

[54:49] podcast.

[54:50] Yeah.

[54:51] We start recording.

[54:52] If we just say, Oh, should we do it this morning?

[54:53] It would just get pushed off.

[54:55] I really, really like this scheduling and why not take it to the next level and schedule

[55:00] more things like evening activities, which typically like naturally you think, no, no,

[55:06] no.

[55:07] I want to be open.

[55:08] I don't, it's family free.

[55:09] Like I'm already busy at work.

[55:10] I don't want my life to feel like work, but planning doesn't really make it feel like

[55:14] work.

[55:15] It's just optimizing for you committing to, to, to what you've decided.

[55:19] I love planning to do the things that you know that you want to do like exercise or

[55:24] like, you know, like doing a cooking class or something like something fun that you're

[55:30] always feeling like you wish you had the time to do scheduling.

[55:33] It doesn't make it like soulless work.

[55:36] It just means that you're actually like making the time.

[55:39] Yeah, exactly.

[55:40] Making the time.

[55:41] Yeah.

[55:42] So it's the incentive, incentivize the thing, like give you the incentive is the decision

[55:46] is made and you've, you've decided, and that's what you're going to do.

[55:52] The same happened to me with this.

[55:54] When you said pre-commits to something, this is, it's work related, but when I wanted to

[55:58] do my epic web stuff for a good month and a half, I was completely overwhelmed with

[56:04] the fact that I work full time.

[56:06] And then I have this 70 videos to record and I was like, I'll never, never going to be

[56:11] able to do it.

[56:12] Should I take a week holiday?

[56:13] Should I, what?

[56:14] And then I was like, maybe I'll try one every day, but then I can't feel like it.

[56:19] And then for some stupid reason, I was like, I'm going to Newcastle with my son next week.

[56:25] I take a week off for basketball.

[56:27] I don't want to have to work or stress about work.

[56:30] So how about I decide that I record all 70 videos and edit them while I work full time

[56:35] this week.

[56:37] And that was, that was a completely abnormal and stupid and unhealthy decision, but I've

[56:42] done it and I record it and I find myself enjoying it.

[56:45] And then now it's done, and I don't know if you've seen Ken's tweets, but it should, in

[56:50] the next two weeks, sometimes release, I've done all I have to do.

[56:54] And this is such a big weight off my shoulders.

[56:57] And the only thing, the only reason it happened is because I pre-committed to it.

[57:02] So that's the, that's the life, life tip right there.

[57:06] The advent calendar, like halfway through the year.

[57:09] And so now is probably a good time to start thinking what's something that I want to commit

[57:13] to do in December, because the December advent calendar is a great way to do something every

[57:21] single day.

[57:22] And so I'm planning to do an advent calendar of content of like Postgres theory, little

[57:29] Postgres tips and tricks that you could learn.

[57:32] And so it's such, such a good way to commit to like, you know, publicly say, I'm going

[57:38] to do this thing.

[57:39] And you can watch a new video on every single day, and you just kind of chip away at this

[57:44] bigger, larger thing.

[57:45] Because I'd love to do like a massive Postgres course.

[57:48] But it's too big.

[57:49] It's too big conceptually.

[57:50] Exactly.

[57:51] It's such a massive thing.

[57:52] And I've got other things that I need to commit to in work time.

[57:54] Amazing, man.

[57:55] Yeah.

[57:56] And so it's a way that you can just kind of chip away at, here's like 25, or if you want

[58:00] to just do a random month, it doesn't have to be December.

[58:02] You could do like 30 or 31 days, like Wes Boss' JavaScript 30, perfect example of that.

[58:08] There's just 30 like challenges that you can do with JavaScript.

[58:12] Yeah.

[58:13] Committing to something, pre-committing to something like that, doing something daily,

[58:17] a little chunk of something daily is a great way to get it done.

[58:20] This is the golden recipe, right?

[58:23] Pre-commit and then chunk into small bite-sized stuff.

[58:26] So you can eat the whole, you know, like how do you eat an elephant?

[58:30] I don't know if I want to, but if I was probably one bite at a time.

[58:34] So you just have to cut tiny little cubes of elephant.

[58:37] Sorry, I don't want to bring this gross topic to the, but yeah, you, that you see, this

[58:42] is very common, like the hundred days of codes, hashtag for beginners that like I'm for a

[58:46] hundred days, I'm going to learn something and share what I know.

[58:50] Unfortunately, these hashtags can kind of like hijacked by growth hackers and grifters

[58:55] and stuff to try to, they would tag this to just get the whole community to see it.

[59:01] But the idea was great.

[59:03] It's like for a hundred days, you do five minutes a day of the same thing and you're

[59:07] going to have, eventually you'll get to 10,000 hours if you do it long enough and then you,

[59:12] you have mastery.

[59:13] Yeah.

[59:14] Amazing.

[59:15] Can you have a sick pick for me before we quickly wrap up?

[59:17] Yes.

[59:18] So a sick pick, I was going to sick pick that last time, but the, the, the in real life

[59:23] event stuff took over.

[59:25] So it's also very aligned to what we discussed.

[59:29] My sick pick is something I've done a few weeks before and it's camping off grid, no

[59:34] electricity, no hot water, no internet, no reception, no nothing.

[59:39] Proper camping.

[59:40] What used to just be called camping.

[59:42] Yeah.

[59:43] Not, not going to a caravan park and plug into the water and electricity and wifi and

[59:48] there's a bathroom with showers that I get cleans every two hours.

[59:51] No, no, no.

[59:52] I go camping in, you drive far enough, which it doesn't have to be far in Australia, but

[59:57] somehow we still made it far.

[59:59] You drive where there's no people, no reception, no, none of the things that you can benefit

[60:06] from day to day.

[60:08] And what it does is the actual opposite of what you described, which is a plan your evenings

[60:14] and calendar.

[60:15] This, this, like this, this, the completely 90 to 180 degrees turn.

[60:20] And we're like, we go there.

[60:22] We don't really know what the weather will be like once we there, we don't have a way

[60:25] to know what the weather will do because we're like off of everything and we know it's going

[60:30] to be cold.

[60:31] So we pack warm clothes and we're going to make a fire and play music by the fire and

[60:35] have a few beers and whatever.

[60:38] And the kids will ride bikes and jump in the river and we have blow up lilos and glide

[60:42] down there.

[60:43] Like this is the overall plan.

[60:44] And we did this for the long weekend, like a three day break.

[60:48] And we rocked up, set up the tent and you're like, okay, now, now what, what should we

[60:53] do next?

[60:54] And the kids are like, oh, can we, can we dig a hole?

[60:56] Can we play with sticks?

[60:58] Oh yeah.

[60:59] Start there.

[61:00] That's a good idea.

[61:01] And my family and another two families of friends that have kids the same age.

[61:07] And then my wife's parents as well came.

[61:09] So it's kind of like we were about 10, 12, 15 people, very low key.

[61:14] No one cares about what anyone's wearing because we all rocked up in like basically being in

[61:19] your cozy pajamas for three days and we did nothing but ride, I didn't ride back, but

[61:26] the kids rode bikes and just sit by the fire and go for a little walks and stuff.

[61:32] And again, you don't track your steps or whatever, just like forget everything for a bit.

[61:39] And then we did this for three days and most people loved it.

[61:42] But me as a engineer looking at screens and technology all the time, the first day I had

[61:48] this, ah, but what if, what if AstroJS releases a release and I need to be on top of it?

[61:54] No, shut up.

[61:55] Shut up, brain.

[61:56] You don't need to be on top.

[61:57] If, if it happens, you could take another three months break and then discover the new

[62:01] thing and then, Hey, make a video and it would, you would still be relevant.

[62:06] So I just, the second day I was like, actually, I do not need to constantly be on top of everything

[62:11] and be the first one to break the news.

[62:14] Newsflash I live in Australia with my time zone.

[62:16] I will always wake up to someone who already broke the news.

[62:19] So why would I try to do this anyway?

[62:22] So the sick pick is get in a situation that forces you to completely cut off with technology

[62:29] and also incentively when it gets dark, you're like, eh, I'm tired.

[62:35] I might go to bed.

[62:36] And then you wake up when the sun comes out and it's like, it's called the circadian rhythm

[62:41] or something.

[62:42] I don't know exact word, but, uh, yes.

[62:44] The science shows that if you go camping long enough without any devices, you can adjust

[62:50] to this, which is, turns out to be very beneficial for your biological clock, especially in winter

[62:56] where the sun goes down early and stays down late.

[62:59] So you end up sleeping 10 hours and it's like, God damn, three nights in a row, sleeping

[63:04] 10 hours.

[63:05] It's like such a life trick to replenish.

[63:09] Yeah, we last, um, autumn, I guess.

[63:13] We bought all of the camping gear.

[63:16] We've never had the camping gear to, to be able to go camping as a family.

[63:20] And so we bought all of the things, uh, and then our camping trip got, uh, postponed or

[63:26] canceled three times, um, which, uh, it's now probably too cold to, to camp with the

[63:33] little ones for their first time camping.

[63:35] But once it warms up again, planning to, uh, to do a big camping trip with friends, it's

[63:40] a lovely way to, to spend some time as a family and get some proper downtime away from technology

[63:47] and screens and everything else.

[63:48] Yeah.

[63:49] How young are we talking?

[63:50] How young are your kids?

[63:51] Uh, two and five.

[63:53] Yeah.

[63:54] So I'm going to challenge this.

[63:56] Turns out, uh, camping sleeping bags is just about the coziest, warmest thing you can be

[64:02] in.

[64:03] It's true.

[64:04] The only trick is to get warm and then manage to take your clothes off and jump in the sleeping

[64:10] or you can even sleep with your clothes on, which is what we ended up doing.

[64:13] But the, like the camping in summer is horrible because you're sweaty and there's mosquitoes

[64:20] and flies and weird noises and people partying like this.

[64:25] It's the worst summer in Australia camping.

[64:27] It's just too hot.

[64:28] And you're in this canvas trapping heat and humidity.

[64:32] When you go camping in winter, you need, you need to be able to make a fire because you're

[64:36] going to be sitting by the fire and as the night gets colder, you go closer and everyone

[64:41] ends with the hand on top of the flame pretty much.

[64:45] And then you're like, okay, I think it's time to go to sleep.

[64:49] And everyone, you can see everyone kind of lining up the, okay, seven steps to the left,

[64:54] take the jacket off, jump, wipe my feet, zip the sleeping bag, and then pray, pray, pray,

[64:59] pray, pray, you don't need to go to the toilet in the middle of the night because this is

[65:03] the worst.

[65:04] But yeah, like you'll find that kids, young, very young kids, cause I'm saying this, not

[65:09] just conceptually.

[65:10] I've done it with my kids when they were really young.

[65:15] It's so easy.

[65:16] It's so much easier to camp in winter.

[65:17] You need good clothing and then a good sleeping bag, but then they sleep like absolute babies.

[65:22] They wrapped up.

[65:23] They never wake up till the morning.

[65:25] And then the morning they wake up, the first thing they want to do is just start a fire

[65:28] and be around the fire again.

[65:30] And it's, yeah, I found, I found much more difficult to camp in summer with kids because

[65:34] they're hot.

[65:35] They're hot.

[65:36] So they're going to put their leg on top of the cover and then mosquitoes bite the leg

[65:40] and then they itchy and then they, yeah, it's, it's actually much easier in cold winters.

[65:45] So I would, I would consider like not ruling it out completely.

[65:49] I know you live in Victoria, which is cold, but when we go camping, we go in mountainy

[65:54] areas that are as cold as Victoria.

[65:56] Hmm.

[65:57] Yeah.

[65:58] It's a, it's a good call.

[65:59] And like, it's so much easier to warm up than it is to cool down.

[66:02] Like if it's hot inside your tent, when you're trying to go to sleep at night, there's not

[66:07] really much that you can do.

[66:08] You can't peel the skin layers or yeah, it's the bottleneck.

[66:13] Yeah.

[66:14] If it's cold and you've got some more clothes you can put on, or you've got like, uh, you

[66:18] know, you've got like a sub degree, uh, sleeping bag, then you'll be fine.

[66:23] Yeah.

[66:24] Sick pics, man.

[66:25] I think that was, that was one of my favorite episodes forever from since we started because

[66:30] it was focused on non, non-technical stuff.

[66:33] We still looked at each other on the screen to record this, but the, the mind was escaping

[66:38] somewhere.

[66:39] Totally.

[66:40] Yeah.

[66:41] We should do this every week.

[66:42] No, no plans.

[66:43] We'll just.

[66:44] Well, you might've noticed we, we talk about technology less and less because we can, uh,

[66:49] like lulling you, uh, into a lifestyle podcast instead of Postgres and Superbase and Think

[66:56] Mill and Keystatic and all that stuff.

[66:59] Quickly on the lifestyle thing, me and my wife were doing one of these, um, high intensity

[67:04] interval training YouTube videos last night and it clicked for me that like, that's, that's

[67:10] where the, like the success in YouTube is because we, like me and you create technical

[67:17] content.

[67:18] Right.

[67:19] And then people watch that video and then they're done with that video.

[67:21] They're not going to rewatch it or they might like rewatch it like a section to solve a

[67:24] problem, but then they're done.

[67:27] If you create like a lifestyle or especially an exercise channel that you do again and

[67:32] again, embed in people's routines that they watch the same video every week, like, like

[67:37] me and my wife at the moment are doing the same high intensity.

[67:41] And so every week we're giving them another view.

[67:44] And so if you like times that across all of the different people that come and happen

[67:47] to find this video and watch it, it's insane.

[67:50] Like the video we're watching has 10 million views and it was only put out like a few months

[67:54] ago.

[67:55] Cause they watch it over and over.

[67:56] It's just like streams on Spotify, like music, you, it becomes your playlist, like your,

[68:01] yep.

[68:02] Like I can't think of the tech version of that.

[68:05] What is the video that people watched once a week?

[68:07] Oh, exactly.

[68:08] Like how do you embed it?

[68:09] Cause once someone learns the topic, like they're not going to go back and watch it

[68:12] again.

[68:13] They'll watch it and then they move to the next need for, yeah.

[68:18] Even better than that.

[68:19] Just, just one more thing.

[68:20] This thing has got me way too excited.

[68:21] One more thing that in the video there's, there's two people and one of them is doing

[68:25] like the, the regular routine.

[68:27] And then the other one is doing like an, a variation version, which is slightly easier.

[68:32] And so not only have they created a video that you can watch every single week, but

[68:35] they've created like the easy version of the video and the hard version of the video.

[68:39] So even when you have gone like advanced beyond the beginner steps, you're still watching

[68:44] the same video.

[68:45] You're still giving, it's insane.

[68:48] Yep.

[68:49] You've described the, the economics of a repeating product, like deodorant where it's finished,

[68:53] you buy another one, another one, another one, or something you buy once, like a really,

[68:58] really good barista coffee machine.

[69:00] And it lasts you like 40 years.

[69:03] Yeah.

[69:04] It's like a way to make something, uh, well, subscription model is kind of that, but it's,

[69:09] it's, it sucks because yeah.

[69:12] It's hard.

[69:13] But you can't do it with content.

[69:14] You can do it with a product, but you can't, like what's the version where you have people

[69:18] coming back to the same YouTube video over and over again in the tech world?

[69:21] This doesn't.

[69:22] No.

[69:23] It's not possible.

[69:24] People come back to the same concept, like you, you see, I will not name names, but there's

[69:29] very specific YouTubers that take an article and read it and comment on it.

[69:33] And they do this every day.

[69:34] And it becomes sort of like dev journalism.

[69:38] And that's that people like drink their coffee and watch that video as a routine, like, like

[69:43] my exercise is to stay plugged in what's happening in the dev industry, but this is still a new

[69:47] video every day.

[69:48] It's, there is no way.

[69:50] Like you might be watching your channel might be embedded in their routine, but rewatching

[69:55] the same thing over and over again.

[69:57] And just like, like skyrocketing the views, like they spend, you know, half an hour doing

[70:02] an exercise routine.

[70:03] They probably hand it off to like an agency to do the editing and stuff and make it like

[70:07] really engaging and add music and things.

[70:10] But then they like, they don't do anything after that point, they've, they've worked

[70:13] maybe half an hour, paid someone a bit of money to do something, but then they have

[70:17] a video that people can watch over and over and over and over again.

[70:20] They don't need to like, we need to change this video.

[70:23] They don't need to update it when some new version comes out, there's no new version

[70:27] of the exercises.

[70:28] You're just working out particular muscles in your body.

[70:32] It's genius.

[70:33] Yep.

[70:34] Yep.

[70:35] Same podcast.

[70:36] We're an exercise podcast now.

[70:37] I instantly thought I could do this with a shooting basketball, shooting mechanics, like

[70:41] a five minute workout.

[70:43] And that would be a video.

[70:44] I wouldn't know how to teach this.

[70:45] I wouldn't know how to edit this.

[70:47] And then people, if they like it, they might watch it.

[70:50] But you have to, you have to frame it as not like, Hey, I'm going to teach you five tips

[70:54] to shoot better.

[70:55] You have to frame it as a 10 minute shooting workout that will transform your, your basketball

[71:01] shooting career.

[71:02] And then you have to, guys, you're going to have to do this every morning.

[71:05] It's five minutes, do it every day for a year.

[71:08] And then say me in the comments, like did something change and then get them to commit

[71:12] to this.

[71:13] And then that's, that's 365 views for just one viewer.

[71:17] Yeah.

[71:18] Uh, you can't, unless you find a way to do a coding warmup that people should do every

[71:23] morning before, like, all right, let's do like some stretching.

[71:26] And then we're going to just turn a, we're going to turn an array of stuff.

[71:30] Like we're going to pop the last element and shift it or shift and whatever.

[71:35] I don't even know.

[71:36] The problem is like with, with tech, the, the, the thing that you're trying to work

[71:39] out is like being presented with an unfamiliar problem and like seeing a pattern in it and

[71:44] being able to find the answer.

[71:45] And so if you're presented with the same problem, you already know the answer.

[71:48] You're not like the bit that you need to work out with coding is like not, not something

[71:53] you can do the same thing over and over again.

[71:55] You could do like a different variation.

[71:56] So maybe if you had like, you know, all right, do this, do this routine daily or weekly or

[72:02] whatever, but like, it's a list of 25 things.

[72:06] And so the first time, like, like, as in you have this, uh, I'm making this very confusing

[72:12] to 30 is exactly what it is.

[72:14] Yeah.

[72:15] You have 25 options for the first exercise and then you have 25 options for the second

[72:19] exercise, 25 options for the third one.

[72:21] And the idea is that you pick a new one from that.

[72:24] So you're still watching the same video over and over again, but you're still producing

[72:28] 25 freaking videos for every step.

[72:30] So it's, but you're back to making, I mean the same video, but you're saying this is

[72:36] like, we're going to learn how to use like the array dot shift method.

[72:40] Um, and here are 25 different slight, like slightly different ways that you could challenge

[72:45] yourself.

[72:46] But yeah.

[72:47] Yeah.

[72:48] I think we'll solve this.

[72:49] Oh, we've got to pivot.

[72:50] The only problem is we are, I think I'm going to solve it for you.

[72:54] Why doesn't work programming is not a physically a straining activity that needs warmup.

[73:01] So you can skip the scale.

[73:03] Like you play guitar, you're going to do you pentatonic scales and like normal scales and

[73:09] minor and majors and singing.

[73:10] You do, you go through the scales and basketball.

[73:13] You go through your warmup routine where you jog slow and then you do little jumps and

[73:16] squats and then you ramp up to get ready for now.

[73:19] Now I'm ready.

[73:20] When we code, we don't go like, okay, let's do 10 air squats and crack our fingers.

[73:24] We don't do any of that.

[73:25] We just sit, open the screen and look at the VS code.

[73:29] Where was I?

[73:30] Oh yeah.

[73:31] Okay.

[73:32] And I'm, and you, and you go straight, which is also why it's a very unhealthy profession

[73:35] because we, we just like roll into it and we can do it all day and then roll to bed

[73:39] and then we don't realize that it's you can also do it all night.

[73:43] Yeah.

[73:44] Oh my God.

[73:45] That's like an episode that basically we're telling you is like, get out of tech because

[73:50] the tech is good, but look, pull your head outside and look outside the bubble because

[73:55] otherwise you're in the bubble.

[73:57] And that is one of the opportunities that tech gives you by, you know, usually salaries

[74:01] are somewhere on the higher end in the tech world.

[74:04] And so you should, rather than using that as an opportunity to work even more and get

[74:09] even more money, use it as an opportunity to not have to work as much and be able to

[74:13] have like a living wage, but be able to have an actual personal life.

[74:18] You have time and you work from home and you have money and it's like, Oh no, let's do

[74:22] more work from home to make more money.

[74:24] So I have less time or some sort of.

[74:27] Yeah.

[74:28] It's a trap.

[74:29] And on that note, thank you so much for listening to this week's episode of the NavBar and we

[74:33] will see you again next week.

[74:35] I enjoyed this one.

[74:36] See you later.

[74:37] Thanks for tuning in.
